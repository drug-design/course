## Introduction

### Properties of a Molecule

Molecules are defined by 2D chemical formulas but the information they carry is not sufficient for  understanding the physical, chemical, or biological properties of the compound. Molecules are 3D entities and only their 3D geometries provide relevant information for understanding such properties.

### Average of a Conformational-Dependent Property

Molecular properties are directly related to the 3D structure of the molecule. When a molecule exists as a mixture of conformers, then any property that this molecule exhibits is an average of that property over all of the conformations it visits, weighted by the conformers populations.

## Biological Properties

### Biological Properties of Proteins

The function of a protein is controlled by its three-dimensional structure. Enzymes and receptors recognize substrates on the basis of their 3D molecular geometries. Drugs also are designed on the basis of their precise 3D properties.

### Biological Properties of Chiral Analgesics

Even very similar compounds such as isomers or stereoisomers may have very different biological properties. Ibuprofen exists as a racemic mixture, only the S enantiomer has analgesic properties. The biological activity/inactivity is directly related to the molecular geometries of the two enantiomers.

## Physical Properties

### Physical Properties

The boiling point, the refractive index or the magnetic susceptibility are physical properties that can be derived from the molecular geometries of the molecules. For example the boiling point of iso-butane (-12<sup>o</sup> C) is lower than that of n-butane (-1<sup>o</sup> C). This is due to the difference in the molecular structures of the two isomers. Isobutane is almost spherical and has less intermolecular forces than n-butane which has an extended geometry.

### Calculation of Other Physical Properties

Theoretical treatments facilitate the calculation of a number of molecular properties and require as input the molecular geometry of the molecule concerned. The properties that can be calculated are electronic properties (ionization potentials, atomic charges, electrostatic potentials, molecular orbitals) or thermodynamic properties (activation energies, enthalpies, entropy, free energies, heat of formation). The picture shows the partial atomic charges for this representative molecule.

## Chemical Properties

### Chemical Properties

A chemical compound has physical and chemical properties that are determined by its precise chemical constitution and architecture. Chemical reactions occur in three-dimensions. The way a chemical reaction develops can be explained by analyzing the reactants and their interactions in three dimensions. This is so important that chemists try to incorporate this information into their two dimensional diagrams using some additional conventions.

### Enolization of Keto-3 Steroids

The enolization of keto-3 steroids occurs as a mixture of the two enolic forms.  There is a greater proportion of the enol with the double bond in the &Delta;<sup>2</sup> position than the one in the &Delta;<sup>3</sup>.  The explanation is given on the following pages.

### Relative Stability of Isomers
*[Isomers]: Isomers are compounds with the same chemical formula but different 2D-structures
*[Isomer]: Isomers are compounds with the same chemical formula but different 2D-structures

A qualitative analysis allows us to explain this preference. At the fusion with ring B the torsion angle of ring A  has a value of about -57<sup>o</sup>; it should become -61<sup>o</sup> (left bottom) or -45<sup>o</sup> (right bottom) after the reaction, which correspond to a variation (in absolute values) of 4<sup>o</sup> and 12<sup>o</sup>, respectively. Assuming that the 4<sup>o</sup> variation will be preferred, this qualitative analysis explains why there are greater proportions of the &Delta;<sup>2</sup> enol.

#### Relative Stability of the two Isomers of Trans-Octalin
*[Isomers]: Isomers are compounds with the same chemical formula but different 2D-structures
*[Isomer]: Isomers are compounds with the same chemical formula but different 2D-structures

The relative stability of the two isomers of trans-octalin can be calculated based on the 3D geometries of the specified compounds.  There is a difference of energy of 2.9 kJ/mol in favor of isomer 1, which is the more stable because it has less strain in the bicyclic moiety.

#### SN2 Mechanism

The nucleophilic attack of R-1-Bromo-1-deuterioethane by an ethoxy ion occurs by a S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism. The carbon atom is accessible for a nucleophilic attack and in the final product its stereochemistry has been inverted.

#### E2 Elimination Mechanism

The same reaction with tert-butylbromide gives a different reaction because for steric reasons the central carbon atom is not accessible. What is observed here is not an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction as in the previous case but an elimination of HBr according to an E2 elimination mechanism.

### Molecular Geometries and Chemical Properties

Theoretical treatments facilitate the calculation of a number of molecular chemical properties. These properties are 3D dependent and include physico-chemical indexes (solubility, lipophilicity), interconversion energies (rotational barriers, ring inversions) and chemical reactivity (electronic indexes, lipophilicity, reaction paths, relative stability of isomers).
