## Introduction

### Beginning the Design Phase

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='ligand-based-approaches/beginning-design-phase-181735f3'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Once the phase of analysis is complete, the design phase can proceed. New lead compounds are designed based on the pharmacophore model obtained in the previous analyses. The aim of the design is to convert all the generated knowledge into candidate molecules to be synthesized (or ordered) for biological testing.

### Creativity of the Design

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='ligand-based-approaches/creativity-design-03379203'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The knowledge accumulated during the phase of analysis determines the success of the design. However, creativity is extremely important as well. The creativity and imagination convert knowledge into 'intelligent' molecules and initiate scientific breakthroughs.

### Good Control of the Conformational Features

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='ligand-based-approaches/good-control-conformational-features-220a7a44'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In all design actions, it is of paramount importance not to overlook the conformational consequences of the planned action. Breaking a ring or introducing a substituent or spacer are all operations that have consequences in the conformational preferences of the designed candidate. The two following examples of butaclamol and staurosporine illustrate the consequences of a design where the conformational implications were mismanaged.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='ligand-based-approaches/intuitive-justification-design-68cc132c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The validity of this hypothesis could be justified by the good superimposition of models of the two structures. But this manipulation is just an exercise that is far from reality.

### Staurosporine Example (Bad Design &#38; Good Results)

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='ligand-based-approaches/staurosporine-example-bad-design-amp-good-results-f2f4e1b7'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Staurosporine is a competitive inhibitor of ATP against many protein kinases. Looking for new EGF-R kinase inhibitors, the structure of CGP52411 was conceived by removing rings and bonds from the 2D formula of staurosporine. The molecule proved to be a EGF-R kinase competitive inhibitor of ATP (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.3 &micro;M).

#### Staurosporine does not Mimic ATP

However, the molecule does not mimic the structure of ATP; it only hinders the anchorage of ATP to the same residues of the catalytic site.

#### CGP52411 is Not a Mimic of Staurosporine

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='ligand-based-approaches/cgp52411-is-not-mimic-staurosporine-db83c156'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>CGP52411 is not a mimic of staurosporine. The latter has a flat molecular geometry due to its polycyclic structure. CGP52411 is not flat and the two anilino moieties are not stable as they are in staurosporine. They must rotate until the van der Waals repulsions between the anilino and the phtalimido moieties have been relieved.

#### Unexpected Favorable 3D Rearrangement

Therefore one cannot expect CGP52411 to be a mimic of ATP. However by chance, the conformational rearrangement of CGP52411 positioned one of the phenyl moieties that rotated exactly at the same place of the sugar fragment of ATP. Finally a mimic of ATP, CGP52411 was found. However from the design point of view, this is not the result of good design considerations but of chance.

### Obvious Design

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='ligand-based-approaches/obvious-design-8c7dbe56'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Sometimes the information discovered through the analysis phase is precise enough that there is no need to look for methods to decide which molecule to prepare. With some intelligence the medicinal chemist can rapidly "see" what molecule to do. Good pharmacophore models carry the necessary information to undertake such "obvious design" operations. One can design a molecule by the "hybrid" assembling elements of different molecules.

## Chemical Modifications

### Principles of Analog Design
*[Analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='ligand-based-approaches/principles-analog-design-b8541be1'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In an analog design program, it is important to avoid introducing several simultaneous changes to the lead reference molecule. Experience shows that useful information can be obtained only when single structural changes in the lead molecule are involved. Changes may be bioisosteric replacements, design of rigid analogs, homologation of alkyl chains, alteration of ring size, etc...
*[analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold
*[analogs]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold
*[bioisosteric]: A compound resulting from the exchange of a group of atoms with another and having similar biological properties to the parent compound.

### Bioisosteric Replacements: Principle
*[Bioisosteric]: A compound resulting from the exchange of a group of atoms with another and having similar biological properties to the parent compound.

Bioisosters are chemical groups that have similar physical properties. Molecules that are designed by bioisosteric replacements are expected to have similar biological properties.
*[bioisosteric]: A compound resulting from the exchange of a group of atoms with another and having similar biological properties to the parent compound.

Synthetic analogs with modified stereochemistries at different chiral centers were prepared but did not lead to therapeutically interesting molecules, except for a special class of steroids called retrosteroids. Retroprogesterone is an example of a synthetic analog that is more active than the natural progesterone.

## Database Searching

### 3D Database Searching

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='ligand-based-approaches/3d-database-searching-b5cb167c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>3D database searching enables one to identify existing molecules that match a pharmacophore hypothesis. The 3D structure of small molecules can be obtained from various sources like crystallographic databases (e.g. CSD), commercially available databases (e.g. FCD) or computerized model-builders (e.g. CONCORD). It is also possible to identify molecules that possess similar 3D shapes. An advantage of this method is that it generally does not require special synthetic efforts (the molecule is known) but on the other hand, it is highly dependent on the content of the database.

### Problems of Conformational Complexity

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='ligand-based-approaches/problems-conformational-complexity-c4829f30'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Molecules are flexible entities. The bioactive conformation of a given compound is one form among the many possible forms of the molecule. Even with the remarkable progress in computer storage technology, it is absolutely impossible to imagine that one could store in a databank all the thousands of possible conformers of every single molecule present in the database. In more recent systems conformational flexible searching has started to be considered. In this case the databank contains one or two conformations for each molecule, however a large number of flexible forms are generated "on the fly". In this approach the limitation is not anymore on the storage capacity but on the computational capabilities.
*[bioactive conformation]: The geometry adopted by a ligand when it binds to its biological target.
*[rms]: Root Mean Square: the square root of the arithmetic average of the square's set of values.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='ligand-based-approaches/introduction-to-manual-design-2e0e9485'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Manual design is based on deciding which molecule to consider next. Without computers, the medicinal chemist currently works like that. Trying to be consistent with the concepts of molecular design, his goal is to fully utilize the information obtained by molecules previously tested and integrate it in the structure of a new molecule to be synthesized.

## Examples of Design

### EGF-R Protein Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
*[Inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[Inhibitors]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='ligand-based-approaches/egf-r-protein-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-e40ba8d8'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The family of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) belongs to the larger class of the trans-membrane growth factor receptor protein kinases. Inhibitors of this enzyme therefore have great therapeutic potential in the treatment of malignant and nonmalignant epithelial diseases. Staurosporine, a microbial alkaloid was found to have some inhibitory effect competing with ATP, the cofactor of the protein kinases.
