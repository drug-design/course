## Case Study-1 : Somatostatin Mimicry

### Somatostatin Structure

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics-case-studies/somatostatin-structure-7bb062a6'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Somatostatin (also known as somatotropin release-inhibiting factor, SRIF) is a cyclic peptide hormone that was discovered in 1973; it is sometimes considered to function as a neurotransmitter. In the following pages we present attempts that were made to discover smaller and non-peptidic molecules having somatostatin-like biological activities.

### Somatostatin Receptors

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics-case-studies/somatostatin-receptors-8d786063'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The somatostatin receptors belong to the family of seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors and constitute an important target in drug discovery. The potential therapeutic applications principally involve the treatment of diabetes (reduced gluconeogenesis by inhibition of insulin and glucagon release), treatment of cancers, but also the treatment of acromegaly (by inhibition of growth hormone release) and ulcers and related gastrointestinal disorders (by inhibition of gastric acid secretion).

### Subtypes of Somatostatin Receptors

### The Drug Discovery Strategy

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics-case-studies/drug-discovery-strategy-95c3c68c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The short duration of somatostatin action limits its use as a drug and has prompted the search for analogs with greater metabolic stability. Since the exact interactions between somatostatin and its receptor are not known, the drug discovery strategy concentrated solely on mimicking the somatostatin structure. The concept used in this approach is outlined in the view below (example taken from substance P mimicry).

This prompted other groups such as Merck and Sandoz to analyze the structure-activity relationships (SAR) in terms of the geometrical conformations of the molecules. Merck proposed a model of the bioactive conformation of somatostatin and also suggested that the minimal peptide sequence necessary for activating the receptor consisted of the Phe7-Trp8-Lys9-Thr10 tetra-peptide sequence.

### Successful Reduction of the Somatostatin

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics-case-studies/successful-reduction-somatostatin-8d8fd92c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Conformationally constrained peptides that proved to be several times more potent and more selective than somatostatin were found. The cyclic hexapeptide compound L-363,377 is an example of the successful reduction of the somatostatin structure that carries the desired structural requirements. L-363,377 is about 50 times more potent than somatostatin in inhibiting insulin secretion.

### An Integrated Approach to Drug Discovery

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics-case-studies/an-integrated-approach-to-drug-discovery-6209b746'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The somatostatin story illustrates the good exploitation of the complementary aspects of different approaches. In a peptidomimetics perspective the pharmacophore analyses, database searching and library design were combined in order to discover potent and selective non-peptidic agonists for each of the five sub-classes of somatostatin receptors. The key to the success was the correct initial analyses of the pharmacophore requirements. This allowed for the successful deployment of a database searching approach to reveal a new and non-peptidic scaffold. Combinatorial chemistry then contributed to the systematic exploration of the stereochemical features of the various receptors, which resulted in the discovery of potent and specific ligands of great potential.
