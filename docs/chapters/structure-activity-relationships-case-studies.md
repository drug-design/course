    Typical examples of S.A.R analyses are presented in this chapter to make it easier to understand structure-activity relationships. The examples show how to observe and carefully differentiate structure-activity observations in minute detail and the ways in which the structural determinants behind the biological activities of a series can be recognized.

## Case Study-1 : Banyu Example

### The Banyu Story with the Urea Structure

Following a structure-based strategy, the Banyu group identified a hit (Cdk4 inhibitors project) having an urea moiety with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 44 &Mu;M. The hit was simplified (ortho substituent removed) in order to derive further knowledge based on SAR analyses. In the following pages an outline of the important steps that enabled successful exploitation of SAR is presented.
*[inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[inhibitors]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[moiety]: Fragments, functional groups or portions of chemical compounds.
*[SAR]: Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR) is the analysis of the relationships between chemical structure and biological activity.

### Bioactive Conformation?
*[Bioactive Conformation]: The geometry adopted by a ligand when it binds to its biological target.

Based on modeling analyses the Banyu group suspected that the binding of the compounds involved the N-H and the carbonyl by forming two hydrogen bonds with the protein, in a bidentate manner. This hypothesis requires a "cis" conformation for the amide fragment concerned.
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.

### Design of Compounds with a Cis Conformation

The aromatic phenyl was replaced by a pyridine, for all possible positions of the nitrogen atom (ortho, meta, para). The increased activity observed only for the 2-pyridyl isomer was interpreted as due to the increased population of the cis conformation (favored by an internal hydrogen bond).
*[isomer]: Isomers are compounds with the same chemical formula but different 2D-structures

### Good Exploitation of the SAR Analyses
*[SAR]: Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR) is the analysis of the relationships between chemical structure and biological activity.

The SAR analyses were further exploited and led to the discovery of very potent and selective compounds such as 15a. In summary, the major steps in this project were (1) discovery of a hit; (2) importance of the urea moiety; (3) modeling the probable bioactive conformation; (4) analogs favoring the cis conformation; (5) lead optimization.

## Case Study-2 : Dioxobenzothiazole Example

### The Dioxobenzothiazole Scaffold

The dioxobenzothiazole scaffold has been the object of SAR studies, in a project aiming at the discovery of CDK4 kinase inhibitors. Starting with the unsubstituted derivative having an IC<sub>50</sub> of 6 &Mu;M, a series of analogs were prepared.

### SAR Analyses
*[SAR]: Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR) is the analysis of the relationships between chemical structure and biological activity.

The binding of the dioxobenzothiazole series can be interpreted in the light the known bidentate hydrogen-bond binding with the conserved kinase hinge. This model provides a basis for understanding the SAR in this series and clarifies why it was not possible to find more potent analogs: the problem is due to steric and polar repulsions between the nitrogen atom of the thiazole and the carbonyl of the hinge for all the analogs prepared. Note that another scaffold containing an N-H group instead of an sp<sup>2</sup> nitrogen atom may lead to more potent compounds.

### Being Trapped with a Bad Scaffold

When a lead is chosen, it is useful to make sure that the corresponding scaffold does not contain structural elements that are constantly detrimental to the biological activities. It is worth spending some time addressing this issue before embarking on an SAR optimization program with a bad scaffold.

The surprising difference in the biological activities observed for 15, 16 and 17 can be understood with 3D analyses. The rationale is only summarized in 2D to make it easier to understand the 3D view presented on the next page. For compounds 15 and 16, and due to the influence of nitrogen atoms on the electronic distribution, a positive charge is induced on the atom meta to N4, whereas in molecule 17 this position is negatively charged.

## Case Study-4 : Nifedipine Example

### Two Inactive Analogs of Nifedipine
*[Analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold
*[Analogs]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold

Nifedipine is a well-known calcium channel antagonist drug used in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders including hypertension. When a methyl group is added to the structure of nifedipine either in the para position of the free phenyl ring (analog 1), or in position 4 of the 1,4-dihydropyridine ring (analog 2), the corresponding molecules are biologically inactive. Analyses of the origin of these inactivities will enable us to understand the molecular determinants that are crucial to the biological activity of nifedipine analogs.

In phenyl-4 dihydropyridine, the 1,4-dihydropyridine ring can exist in two alternative boat conformations: the phenyl substituent is either in the axial or in the equatorial orientation. In the absence of substituents at the 3 and 5 positions of that ring, the phenyl substituent prefers to be in the equatorial position, as generally found in phenyl substituted rings.

### Preferred Conformation of Nifedipine

Contrary to the rule stated on the previous page, the preferred conformation of nifedipine corresponds to the one with the nitrophenyl in the axial position because this orientation enables the molecule to avoid the steric clashes that are created between the nitrophenyl group and the methylester substituents at the 3 and 5 positions.

### Preferred Conformation of Methyl-4 Nifedipine

The presence of the methyl substituent at position 4 of the dihydropyridine ring changes the conformational preference of the methyl-4 nifedipine molecule, and in this case, the preferred conformation of the molecule corresponds to the equatorial orientation of the nitrophenyl group. This has been confirmed by theoretical calculations and by X-ray crystallography. The energetic profile of methyl-4 nifedipine is compared to nifedipine in the figure below.

## Case Study-5 : Carbonic Anhydrase Example

### The Carbonic Anhydrase Protein

Carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the reversible reaction involving hydration of carbon dioxide and dehydration of carbonic acid. There are a number of isozymes of carbonic anhydrase. The isozyme, CA-II is found in red blood cells and other cells including the ciliary body of the eye. All the isoenzymes have a molecular weight of approximately 30,000 and contain one zinc atom per molecule. In the following pages we present how structure-activity relationship analyses led to the discovery of inhibitors of Carbonic anhydrase with sub-nanomolar activities.
*[inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[inhibitors]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.

### Therapeutic Utility of CA Inhibitors
*[Inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[Inhibitors]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are involved in multiple actions in the body. They decrease the formation of aqueous humor (the fluid found in the anterior chamber of the eye), resulting in decreased intraocular pressure, helping in the treatment of glaucoma. They also cause a diuretic type of action in the kidneys, which increases the amount of urine excreted. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors appear to have some effect on the central nervous system (CNS) and have been found to be useful in the treatment of certain CNS disorders, such as epilepsy, when used together with other appropriate medications.

*[Enantiomer]: Enantiomers are pairs of stereoisomers that are mirror images of one other

The X-ray of both complex MK-417 and its enantiomer show a good superimposition between the two ligands. Why is MK-417 100 times more potent than its enantiomer ?

#### Bioactive Conformation of MK-417
*[Bioactive Conformation]: The geometry adopted by a ligand when it binds to its biological target.

Why is the bioactive conformation of MK-417 axial ? MK-417 can adopt two conformations with axial and equatorial side chain. The equatorial conformation energy is 4.2 kJ/mol lower than the axial conformation. But equatorial conformation does not fit in the active site.
*[bioactive conformation]: The geometry adopted by a ligand when it binds to its biological target.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-activity-relationships-case-studies/carbo_12_5_4_1.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Energy Considerations

Why does the R-enantiomer have an equatorial-gauche conformation? The two possible conformations, axial and the lower energy equatorial of R-enantiomer, cannot fit into the active site. To enter into the active site, the equatorial conformation must adopt a less energetically favored gauche conformation.

#### Results of the Analyses

Conclusion: calculations show that the MK-417(S-axial-trans) is lower in energy than its enantiomer R-equatorial-gauche. This explains why MK-417 is more potent than its R-enantiomer.

## Case Study-6 : &beta;-Lactam Antibiotics

### Antibiotic Activities in the Cephalosporin Series

In the course of synthetic work on cephalosporins, analogous compounds were prepared in which the double bond was in the &Delta;<sup>2</sup> position. It was observed that these cephalosporins were devoid of any antibiotic action. We describe in the following pages attempts that were made to understand the observed SAR.

### Stereochemical Hypothesis

At the time this observation was made the &alpha; stereochemistry of the penicillin carboxylic function was already known from X-ray crystallography, but in the &Delta;<sup>2</sup> cephalosporin this stereochemistry had not yet been proven. It was therefore suspected that the biological inactivities of the &Delta;<sup>2</sup> cephalosporins were possibly due to a "wrong" configuration of this carboxylic function in the &beta; orientation.

#### Same Stereochemistry in the two Structures

Subsequent studies showed that the absolute configuration of the carboxy group was, in fact, &alpha; and therefore identical with the one in penicillins.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-activity-relationships-case-studies/betam_12_2_2_1.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Inactivity not due to a Wrong Stereochemistry

The biological inactivity was then attributed to a difference in the stability of the &beta;-lactam ring and not to a "wrong" carboxy configuration.

### Attempts Towards a Geometrical Interpretation

New attempts were made by analyzing the geometrical properties and were carried out with X-ray studies. The 3D comparison of active penicillins, &Delta;<sup>3</sup> and &Delta;<sup>2</sup> cephalosporins was expected to reveal obvious similarities between the active compounds, penicillin and &Delta;<sup>3</sup> cephalopsorin. Surprisingly it showed that penicillin more closely resembled the inactive &Delta;<sup>2</sup> cephalosporin.

#### Flexibility of the Enzyme ?

It was concluded that the geometrical requirements were not very restrictive as regards identifying the antibiotics as a substrate by the enzymes. The flexibility of the enzyme was also believed to easily adapt to the geometrical features of the molecules. However, the inactivity of the &Delta;<sup>2</sup> cephalosporins remained unaccounted for.

### The Lactam Nitrogen Pyramidality Hypothesis

In the X-ray studies it was also found that the lactam nitrogen atom of the &Delta;<sup>2</sup> cephalosporins was almost planar, in contrast to the pyramidal character existing in Penicillin and &Delta;<sup>3</sup> cephalosporin antibiotics. The biological activities observed in the three families of compounds were again attributed to the chemical reactivity of the &beta;-lactam amide bond.

### Deficiency of the Nitrogen Pyramidality Hypothesis

While developing a thienamycin antibiotic with high antibacterial properties, &Delta;<sup>1</sup>-thienamycin, a double bond isomer of thienamycin, was discovered but it was devoid of any antibiotic activity.

#### Penem and Carbapenems

At the same time, the antibacterial activities of even simpler but similar highly strained &beta;-lactams were studied. It was found that penem and &Delta;<sup>2</sup> carbapenem possess potential antibacterial activities, whereas &Delta;<sup>1</sup> carbapenem was found to be inactive.

#### Pyramidality of Nitrogen Atom ?

Analyses of the chemical reactivity of the molecules were made to assess the validity of the nitrogen pyramidality hypothesis. The ease of hydrolysis of the inactive &Delta;<sup>2</sup> carbapenem compared well with that of the active parent compounds. Moreover, the pyramidality of the nitrogen atom in that molecule is highly pronounced, and this observation runs counter of the nitrogen pyramidality hypothesis.

The pyramidal character of the nitrogen atom is not sufficient to interpret the biological activities. The geometrical features, although not yet clearly understood, may play an important role in the biochemical process involved. Analyses of the geometrical features need to be reassessed.

### Bioactive Conformation of Penicillins?
*[Bioactive Conformation]: The geometry adopted by a ligand when it binds to its biological target.

It is imperative to pay close attention to the conformational possibilities of molecules. In particular the bicyclic penam nucleus of penicillins is capable of pseudorotating movements. In this process, the cyclic system can modify the orientation of the substituents and its geometry as shown here.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-activity-relationships-case-studies/penicillin1.gif){: loading=lazy }

#### Pseudorotation of the Penam Ring

In the conformation shown on the left side, the carboxy group is in a pseudo-axial orientation (the X-ray data that was available and used in the attempts that failed to find a geometrical interpretation), whereas in the conformation shown on the right side it is pseudo-equatorial.

#### The two Forms were Found in X-ray Determinations
*[rms]: Root Mean Square: the square root of the arithmetic average of the square's set of values.

The two forms have been experimentally observed in crystallographic studies. Small variations of energies accompany this process, and the carboxy group can easily fluctuate between the two positions. Molecular modeling studies show that the pseudo-axial form is more stable than the pseudo-equatorial one (difference of energy of about 2.9 kJ/mol).

### Revealing Bioactive Conformation of Penicillins
*[Bioactive Conformation]: The geometry adopted by a ligand when it binds to its biological target.

It is possible to establish a geometric separation between active and inactive structures by considering the penicillin in the pseudo-equatorial orientation. When the different structures are superimposed, the view reveals the sharp geometrical difference between the active and inactive structures.

#### Modeling Analyses

The initial difficulty in clarifying the 3D features was in fact due to the existence of a stable pseudo-axial form of penicillin. It appeared in molecular models and also in X-ray crystallography data as perfectly capable of mimicking the inactive compounds.

### Separation Between Active and Inactive Molecules
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer

As shown in the previous view, the active molecules have the carboxy group much closer to the &beta;-lactam amide function than the three inactive geometries. The distance between the oxygen &beta;-lactam amide and the carbon carboxy group was found to be a measure of activity. All active compounds have a distance of 3.0-3.9 &#8491;, whereas inactive compounds have a distance of more than 4.1 &#8491;.

### Validation and Perspectives

Attempts to restore antibiotic activities to the inactive &Delta;<sup>2</sup> cephalosporin scaffold were not successful. The advent of X-ray crystallography of bacterial trans-peptidases has given new impetus to this area. These enzymes catalyze the formation of the cross-linked bacteria cell wall, a construction that provides structural strength and protection to bacteria. Here is shown the structure of a cephalosporin bound to the active site of a transpeptidase.

### Torsion Angle N3-C4-N4-C1' is Important for Potency

The SAR data assembled for the 4-anilino-quinazoline suggest that the torsion angle &Phi; (N3-C4-N4-C1') which controls the position of the anilino phenyl group is important for potency; since good biological activities are associated with small values for this angle (close to zero degrees), and correspond to a flat structure with an extended conformation.

The docking of the 4-anilino-quinazoline lead with the EGF-R protein kinase reveals the binding mode described in the following figures. Note that the N-H anilino group is not involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds with the receptor; note also that the two substituents at positions 7 and 9 are pointing towards the outside of the protein (a feature that will be exploited for conceiving more soluble drug candidates). These predictions were confirmed by X-ray studies.
