### Molecular Structure and Molecular Properties

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/molecular-structure-molecular-properties-68ed57fc'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>One of the most pervasive postulates in the life sciences is that all molecular properties are coded by and consequently result from molecular structure. Some examples of structure-property relationships are illustrated on the following pages.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/structure-property-relationships-example-3-a25e1959'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Saccharin (usually sold as sodium saccharin) binds to the sweet taste T1R3 receptor located in the plasma membrane of the sweet-taste sensory cells located in the taste buds. Binding of saccharin to T1R3 initiates a cascade of events in the taste-sensory cell that eventually releases a signaling molecule to an adjoining sensory neuron, causing the neuron to send impulses to the brain. In the brain, these signals cause the actual sensation of sweetness.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/molecular-descriptors-75a51f4d'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Thus, the derivation of a direct relation with the molecular structure of one single property is extremely challenging. However, structural factors known as molecular descriptors that influence the molecular property can be identified. For this reason, the QSAR model correlates the property with molecular descriptors.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/application-qsar-12dafffe'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>QSAR models are built for three main reasons: to understand the relationship between structure and activity, design compounds with improved activity, and predict the activities of compounds prior to their synthesis. These reasons in fact adhere to the rational sequence of a QSAR analysis project where the first step is to understand the phenomenon, and then use this understanding to design new compounds.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/birth-qsar-66c2e685'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>QSAR dates back to the 19th century with the work of Cros (1863) who first observed an inverse correlation between the toxicity of alcohols and their water solubility. Other important milestones include work by Crum-Brown and Frazer who related physiological action to chemical constitution (1868). A few years later Horst, Overton and Richet independently observed that the toxicity of organic compounds depended on their lipophilicity/solubility. This discovery was followed by research by Meyer and Overton, who proved that anesthetic potency correlated well with partition coefficients (1899).

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/foundations-qsar-f7ed7d24'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>During the first half of the 20th century, Louis Hammett laid the foundation for modern QSAR by correlating electronic properties of organic acids and bases with their equilibrium constants and reactivity. An important landmark in the development of QSAR took place in 1964 with the introduction of the Free-Wilson method and Hansch analysis. This section covers these three seminal contributions to QSAR in some detail.

### The Hammett Contribution

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/hammett-contribution-35bcf8d5'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The dissociation of HA organic acids is a process by which a proton (H<sup>+</sup>) is removed from the neutral compound, leaving behind a negatively charged species (A<sup>-</sup>). The extent of the reaction is measured by the dissociation constant K. Louis Hammett observed that the dissociation constants of aromatic acids are influenced by the electronic properties of the substituents on the phenyl ring.

### Hansch Contribution

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/hansch-contribution-0d2f065a'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Corwin Hansch recognized the importance of lipophilicity for biological activity. Lipophilicity can be defined as the tendency of a compound to prefer an organic phase rather than an aqueous phase. Molecular lipophilicity is correlated with the presence of hydrophobic groups (e.g. aromatic rings) and with the absence of polar and ionizable groups.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/importance-lipophilicity-c9d0d516'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>To exert its biological effect, a drug must reach its site of action. On its way, the compound encounters biological barriers. For example, the cell membrane is composed of a lipid bilayer, therefore lipophilic compounds are able to penetrate such barriers. The lipophilicity thus determines in part the amount of the compound that reaches the target site.

An equation that fits the data of a training set precisely can yield an equation that is perfect mathematically but meaningless for molecules other than those in the training set. For example if the training set consists of 20 molecules, it is always possible to select a set of 20 randomly chosen descriptors and solve the mathematical system for 20 equations and 20 unknowns. This error is known as data-overfitting.

However, it is implausible to assume that the biological activity can increase indefinitely by increasing the lipophilicity of the molecules. It is known that highly lipophilic compounds cannot reach their site of action, because they are trapped in lipophilic environments. It is therefore more realistic to improve the initial model using a non-linear equation. The modified equation proved to be correct and revealed the existence of an optimum logP value, information that could not be derived from molecules with a small range of logP values.

#### The Mathematics of r<sup>2</sup>

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/mathematics-rsup2-0486a5cb'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Mathematically, r<sup>2</sup> is calculated by dividing the fraction of variance explained by the model (the "explained sum of squares", ESS) by the original variance (the "total sum of squares", TSS). ESS, the fraction of variance explained by the model is equal to the total variance (TSS) minus that portion of the variance which was not explained by the model (residual, RSS).

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/rss-explained-variance-f8758411'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In order to obtain RSS, the variance explained by the QSAR model, we start from the fact that the total variance is the sum of the explained and unexplained variances. Thus, the explained variance is the difference between the total variance and the unexplained variance. That portion of the variance which is left unexplained by the QSAR model (unexplained variance) can be obtained by finding the difference between the measured activity and the predicted activity (as given by the regression line).

### t-test for Single Descriptors and Significance of r<sup>2</sup>

We repeat the process of deriving of a QSAR equation and calculate the resulting r<sup>2</sup> values many times, each one using a different descriptor. If the number of molecules is large (> 30), the sampling distribution of the resulting r<sup>2</sup> values will have a normal (i.e., Gaussian) shape. If the number of molecules is small, it will have a shape known as a t-distribution.

#### Shape of t-distribution and Number of Molecules

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/shape-t-distribution-number-molecules-7098c320'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>A value r<sup>2</sup> = 1 will always be obtained for a set of two molecules irrespective of the descriptor used for the QSAR analysis however, as the number of molecules increases, the probability of obtaining large r<sup>2</sup> values with irrelevant descriptors decreases. This probability corresponds to the area under the t-distribution curve (see below), away from the center (where r<sup>2</sup> = 0). The shape of the t-distribution therefore depends on the number of molecules used in the analysis.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/students-t-test-procedure-3bf994dd'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The Student t-test employs the t-distribution to test whether the correlation coefficient obtained from the QSAR analysis is significantly different from 0.

Technically, the steps involved in the Student t-test are as follows.

### F-test for Assessing the Significance of r<sup>2</sup>

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/f-test-for-assessing-significance-rsup2-7e4de4d2'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The F-test is an extension of the t-test for the case of many descriptors. Like the t-test it tests (and hopefully rejects) the assumption that the model did not explain any of the original variance in the data set (i.e., ESS = 0). Like the t-test, the F-test uses an F-distribution which, similar to the t-distribution depends on the number of compounds and descriptors.

### Assessing the Predictive Power of a Model

However, these parameters basically only tell us about the ability of the QSAR model to reproduce the data from which it was derived and not its aptitude to predict the activities of new compounds. Two methods are presented in the following pages to estimate the predictive power of a QSAR model.

*[SAR]: Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR) is the analysis of the relationships between chemical structure and biological activity.

#### The Test Set Method

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/test-set-method-d095aa84'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The first method is known as the "test set method" and consists of partitioning the initial data into two sets, a preferred strategy when a large set of compounds is available. The initial data set is randomly divided into two parts; the first one is used to build a QSAR model and the second one to validate this model.

#### The Cross Validation Method

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/cross-validation-method-e4178131'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The second method is known as "the cross validation method" - it is preferred when the size of the data set is too small. In this method the data are randomly divided into N equal parts; N-1 parts are used to build the model which is then used for the remaining N<sup>th</sup> part to predict the activities of the corresponding molecules. The procedure is repeated until the activities of all compounds have been predicted independently.

#### Limits of the Cross Validation Method

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/limits-cross-validation-method-ed06c3c6'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>With the cross validation method, the QSAR model that is ultimately used to predict the activities of new compounds is derived from all N data points and is therefore different from the N partial QSAR models (i.e. those derived from the N-1 data points). Therefore cross validation does not provide us with the predictive power of a specific QSAR equation but rather with an estimate of our ability to make predictions for compounds similar to those used in our QSAR analysis.

#### The Predictive Index Q<sup>2</sup>

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/predictive-index-qsup2-1cb39143'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The predictive power of the model, termed Q<sup>2</sup>, is computed by analogy with r<sup>2</sup>, the difference being the use of the PRESS (predicted sum of squares) rather than the RSS (residual sum of squares) in the numerator. PRESS is calculated as the difference between the measured activity and the predicted activity for the test set compounds.

### Summary

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar/summary-a4766e8a'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>When discussing mathematical tools available for assessing the quality of a QSAR model we saw that (1) the standard deviation is an isolated "absolute" index of local meaning; (2) with r<sup>2</sup> it is possible to compare different models, but this index is only mathematical - not statistical; (3) t and F have a statistical content that can be used for single and multiple linear regression respectively; however they only measure the ability of the QSAR model to reproduce the data from which it was constructed.
