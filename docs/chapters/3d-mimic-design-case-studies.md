## Case Study-1 : Cimetidine Mimicry

### Two Very Different H2-Antagonists

It is difficult to imagine how they can mimic each other. On the following page we present  the 3D mimicry between these two structures, a model that was exploited for the design of entirely novel antagonists.

### 3D Mimicry between Cimetidine and Triazole
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='3d-mimic-design-case-studies/3d-mimicry-between-cimetidine-triazole-20d53ea9'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The observed biological activities  can now be understood by examining  this conformation for cimetidine that now mimics the triazole molecule well. Such analyses were virtually impossible by simple  observation  of the 2D chemical formulas of the molecules but the resulting 3D model (see button "3D mimicry") provides a good basis  for the design of novel H2-antagonists.

Three different receptors for the mammalian tachykinins have been identified (NK-1, NK-2 and NK-3) and belong to the G-protein coupled receptors family. Substance P is recognized by the NK-1 receptor. Although its 3D structure is unknown, the conformation of substance P when bound to this receptor has been postulated. Here we present  how this conformation has been exploited for the design of non-peptide mimics with nano-molar activities.
