Hippocrates is probably the first physician to reject superstitions with causing illness. His therapeutic approach was relying on the healing power of nature. He revolutionized medicine in ancient Greece, establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields traditionally associated with philosophy and religion. Hippocrates is widely considered to be the father of medicine.

In the ancient Rome Galien conceived a number of drugs; at this time they were searching for universal drugs which were conceived as a mixture of many drugs; some of them could contain more than 100 components. He considered that the human body is formed of the four elements, earth, water, air and fire which shape the outside world, and which contain four humours, blood, choler, phlegm and melancholy; the disease results from a loss of balance between all these elements. He perpetuated Hippocratic medicine and used opium for the relief of pain.

It is only in the 13<sup>th</sup> century that the first apothecary shops appeared; they were preparing and selling herbal medical preparations. People relied on apothecary shops for treatments for every type of ailment, from tetanus to tumors, from headaches to hair loss. The first apothecary shops were founded during the Middle Ages in Baghdad (8th century).

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-discovery/16th-century-pharmaceutical-science-a720e0aa'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>
Pharmaceutical science emerged as a science in the 16th century. The Swiss physician-chemist Paracelsus advocated to abandon the illusive quest of gold by alchemy and to use chemistry for the preparation of medicines. The first pharmacopoeia appeared in Germany in 1542 with an inventory of drugs with instructions on their use and preparation.

In 1796 the English surgeon Edward Jenner conceived the concept of vaccination by observing that dairymaids seemed to have immunity to smallpox. He used the cowpox virus to test the idea and the trial proved to be successful: the principle of vaccination was born. The idea was exploited ninety years later by Louis Pasteur for the development of rabies vaccine; these were a major breakthrough in the fight against these new types of diseases.

It was not always clearly understood how medications must be delivered in order to be effective. Apothecaries made pills that were designed to be swallowed, pass through the gastrointestinal tract, be retrieved from the stool, and used again. However, it was found that not all drugs could be absorbed into the body from the gastrointestinal tract. Other routes of delivery were searched where drugs could be injected directly into the bloodstream; this led to the design in 1853 by the French surgeon Charles Gabriel Pravaz of the hollow hypodermic needle that was first tested on dogs. These discoveries were of great significance and represent the first steps in drug dosage and administration.

The 19<sup>th</sup> century was the time of characterization of natural products by breaking them down into simpler components. It was also the "organic synthesis" time aiming to transform and synthesize organic compounds. Synthetic chemistry enabled the discovery of many therapeutic agents such as chloral, chloroform, aspirin, salicylates and quinine.

Phenol started to be used as an anti-infective agent in the prevention of infectious diseases and chloral hydrate was introduced and became the first synthetic sedative-hypnotic drug. Nitroglycerin was found as a relaxant agent (it was later found that this class of organic nitrates are also useful in the treatment of heart problems). A number of new agents were introduced during this period as for example acetanilide (analgesic-antipyretic), the artificial sweetener saccharin and benzocaine (the first of many local anesthetics).

Following an outstanding pioneer approach Paul Ehrlich developed in 1910 Arsphenamine for the treatment of syphilis. This was the first drug synthesized to kill a specific invading microorganism. Ehrlich was the first who synthesized and tested a large number of compounds to find the most effective molecule. This screening approach remains one of the most important methods used by the pharmaceutical industry to discover new drugs.

Vitamins are necessary for body metabolism and must be provided from the diet. Most of the vitamin deficiency disorders were proven in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. An example proving their importance is the dramatic story of the Japanese sailors who suffered from the terrible *beriberi* disease. Japanese sailors main diet consisted of polished white rice, which is very poor in thiamine (vitamin B1). The preliminary polishing treatment of the white rice removed the important thiamine, a molecule required for glucose metabolism and for construction of neuron membranes, among other functions.

Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928 but he was unable to prepare enough material to carry out human trials. The discovery remained a laboratory curiosity. Ten years later Florey and Chain at Oxford University purified penicillin in sufficient quantity to collect new evidence on the remarkable power of the molecule and to prove its value as a drug. They imagined the setup of a series of small factories in UK for the production of the molecule but finally in the early 1940s, they sought help in America.

Florey played a crucial role in convincing the US pharmaceutical companies to undertake the large-scale production of penicillin. The project was very risky; however Pfizer's management took the leap and voted the investment of millions of dollars to buy the equipment and facilities needed for the mass production.

Pfizer succeeded to develop a process for producing penicillin based on deep tank fermentation techniques, a process which was shared with 19 other US pharmaceutical companies. Looking for massive quantities to support the war effort, the U.S. government financed the project and soon Pfizer was producing five times more penicillin than originally anticipated. The drug started to be used by the Allied forces in Normandy in 1944 and for the rest of the war; it contributed saving countless lives.

An important era of antibiotic discovery took place in the mid 20th century; a great number of antibacterial agents were isolated from plants as for example streptomycin, choramphenicol and tetracyclines. In particular the American biochemist Selman Abraham Waksman (1888-1973) contributed to the discovery of Streptomycin and over twenty other antibiotics - a word which he coined.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are analgesic drugs that were discovered in the 1960s and represent a major breakthrough in drug discovery. This is a new class of drugs that relief pain and reduce inflammation. Aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and voltaren are examples of members of this class. Most of them share the common phenyl-acetic-acid motif.

In the mid 1990's pharmaceutical companies searched for a new class of anti-inflammatory agents termed COX-2 inhibitors expected to have advantages over conventional non-selective COX inhibitors (NSAIDs) since the gastrointestinal effects such as ulceration, and internal bleeds are mediated by COX-1. In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Vioxx that became a blockbuster with annual sales over $ 2 billions. In 2004 Vioxx was withdrawn from the market due to increased risk of heart attack and stroke.

For structure-based design applications in drug discovery, the 3D structure of the target protein needs to be available. In-silico homology modeling has been developed to generate 3D models of a protein of known sequence and unknown structure. The basis of homology modeling is the assumption that proteins with sufficient sequence homology are likely to fold similarly. The primary requirement is to detect sequence similarities with proteins of known X-ray structures. Sequence alignments are then used to produce structural models of the protein considered.

Knowing the binding energy of a ligand to a protein is of utmost importance in drug discovery. Based on molecular dynamics, and the experimental binding free energy of a known inhibitor, it is possible to calculate the free energy of binding of other inhibitors with a method called "Free Energy Perturbation (FEP)". The method requires substantial computer time and is used by specialists in appropriate cases.

### Outline of Drug Discovery
<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-discovery/outline-drug-discovery-9debdf4f'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>
The drug discovery process involves the identification of a promising hit, the transformation of this hit into a lead and optimization of the lead according to multiple criteria presented later in this section. It is also during that phase that patent applications start to be filed. This R&#38;D phase generally requires 4-5 years and may cost about $40 millions dollars to the pharmaceutical company.

"Formulation" is an important aspect of drug discovery. It studies the results of different delivery forms to decide the optimal way for giving the drug to a patient.The more common delivery forms are oral tablets or capsules, oral liquids, topical ointments and injections. There are a vast array of possible dosage forms including transdermal patches, inhalers and intranasal medicines.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-discovery/bioavailability-113f92ad'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>
Bioavailability describes the fraction of a drug that reaches the systemic circulation. A medication administered intravenously, is 100% bioavailable; however, when it is administered via other routes such as orally, its bioavailability decreases due to incomplete absorption. Oral drugs have to pass through the liver before they can circulate in the blood stream; also the blood-brain barrier prevents many drugs from reaching the brain. Poor bioavailability is very often associated with poor water solubility and the ability for a drug to penetrate membranes is mainly governed by its lipid solubility (and molecular weight).

R&#38;D based pharmaceutical companies must protect their drug discoveries. Molecules or classes of molecules, formulations containing the molecule(s), process for making the compound, intermediates involved in the process, and uses of the compound(s) for the treatment of a particular disease must be claimed in a patent to protect the discovery. Only through patent protection can the company hope to earn enough to recoup their R&#38;D investment.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-discovery/lifetime-effective-lifetime-patent-60652c12'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>
Drug discovery plays a pivotal role in contributing to the extension of the patents of the company. Patent extension is vitally important in the pharmaceutical industry because by the time a drug is marketed as much as 12 years of patent protection may have elapsed. This means that without extension the effective patent term is only 8 years. For example, a new formulation can be used to obtain a patent extension.

Up to the 1980's drug discovery was mainly driven by a collaboration between medicinal chemists and biologists. All other disciplines supported the research team with experts contributing as consultants rather than full members of the core drug discovery research unit. In the mid 1980's the situation changed in many companies and the molecular modeler started to be a full member of the core research team.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-discovery/two-major-approaches-5c52c37d'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>
Rational drug design is based on a molecular understanding of the interactions between the drug and its target in biological systems. When the 3D structure of the target protein is known, this information can be exploited for the design of new ligands. When the three-dimensional structure of the target protein is not available, one can exploit the information provided by known active molecules. The interaction with the target protein remains the central issue, however the design is made indirectly.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-discovery/molecular-complementarity-9e52ff73'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>
When the 3D structure of the target protein is available, the molecular complementarity can be easily seen. The principal forces involved upon the binding of a ligand to a biological system are: hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding and electrostatic forces. Energy dictates molecular associations between a protein and a ligand and controls all these interactions: they are exploited in drug discovery to maximize the binding of a candidate molecule.

With the aim of developing develop an antihypertensive drug acting as renin inhibitor Novartis used a 3D homology model of the enzyme to predict the binding mode of a potent reference peptide. This complex served as a basis for the design of orally available non-peptidic inhibitors. This led to the discovery of Aliskiren (Tekturna), a drug now used for the treatment of high blood pressure. Molecular modeling played a central role in the discovery and development of this drug for which the team received the prize "2009 Heroes in Chemistry" from the American Chemical Society.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-discovery/therapeutic-risk-project-f05654a4'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>
Drug discovery is driven by innovation and competition. Some projects are very risky because the corresponding target remains to be validated. Less risky projects are those based on the copy of an existing drug having a validated target. From the managerial point of view both approaches remain valid and in both cases scientists involved in drug discovery know exactly what to do.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-discovery/prepare-crystals-protein-or-complex-cf1957f9'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>
Preparing protein crystals suitable for structural analysis is currently the bottleneck in structure determination by X-ray crystallography. One method used by the X-Ray Crystallographer is to start by getting few crystals to grow in the highly supersaturated solution. Then the crystals are exposed to a less saturated solution so they can grow. This is done either by moving the crystals or changing the saturation of the solution.

### Synthesis of Complicated Molecules
<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-discovery/synthesis-complicated-molecules-68d8e568'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>
Complicated natural molecules can be prepared by total synthesis, and this is of great importance in drug discovery. Synthetic chemistry opened the way of making by total synthesis molecules that are found in nature only in small quantities, but it also opened the possibility of making analogs of these natural compounds to find those with the most interesting biological potential.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-discovery/parallel-drug-discovery-c97c5de5'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>
Recent developments in robotics for synthetic chemistry allow the automated preparation of many compounds involving different reactions "in parallel". The biological tests are made either on purified compounds or on mixtures.

#### Combinatorial Drug Discovery
<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-discovery/combinatorial-drug-discovery-1d098b61'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>
Many analogs of a given scaffold can be synthesized with combinatorial chemistry. One part of a molecule is maintained, as different chemical groups are attached to its molecular framework to produce a series of similar molecules. Only a few milligrams of compounds can be obtained by this method, however this is generally sufficient for primary biological screening.

## The Present and Future Face of Drug Discovery

### Outsourcing: an Important Cultural Shift
<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-discovery/outsourcing-an-important-cultural-shift-c4128da0'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>
Pharmaceutical companies are currently outsourcing about one fourth of their R&#38;D expenses. It spans the entire R&#38;D activity from combinatorial chemistry to clinical trials. This important cultural shift proved to reduce the heavy investment in infrastructure which would normally be necessary for the company.

A number of important issues have great impact on the way that drug discovery develops in a pharma company. There is a lot of strain on the management of a company for maintaining the drug portfolios. Pharmaceutical companies have to be prepared to tell what to do when disaster strikes, when a new area must be developed, when a patent expires, when an acquisition must be made, when a late stage failure occurs.

Severe or fatal myelosuppression has been associated with an inherited deficiency in thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT). Before starting a therapy with mercaptopurine, the TPMT levels of the patient are measured to be sure that there are no risks of drug-induced myelosuppression due to impaired clearance of the drug (the induced adverse event can be fatal).

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-discovery/stem-cell-therapy-15243d00'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>
A completely new type of therapy is now emerging based on the capability of stem cells to be grown and transformed into specialized cells. In particular, this discovery has the potential to regenerate damaged and diseased organs but it also raises ethical issues concerned with the culture and use of stem cells derived from human embryos that has not been fully addressed. Areas where stem cell therapy can be applied include the following.
