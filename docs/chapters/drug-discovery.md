## From the Origin of Medicines to Today

### Attempts to Cure Diseases in Antiquity

Since antiquity people have tried to cure diseases by eating or applying substances they found in their natural environment. These attempts were based on intuition or on empirical observations.

Hippocrates is probably the first physician to reject superstitions with causing illness. His therapeutic approach was relying on the healing power of nature. He revolutionized medicine in ancient Greece, establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields traditionally associated with philosophy and religion. Hippocrates is widely considered to be the father of medicine.

### 2nd Century: The Roman Period

In the ancient Rome Galien conceived a number of drugs; at this time they were searching for universal drugs which were conceived as a mixture of many drugs; some of them could contain more than 100 components. He considered that the human body is formed of the four elements, earth, water, air and fire which shape the outside world, and which contain four humours, blood, choler, phlegm and melancholy; the disease results from a loss of balance between all these elements. He perpetuated Hippocratic medicine and used opium for the relief of pain.

### 13th Century: First Apothecary Shops
*[Apo]: 3D structure of a macromolecule without a ligand

It is only in the 13<sup>th</sup> century that the first apothecary shops appeared; they were preparing and selling herbal medical preparations. People relied on apothecary shops for treatments for every type of ailment, from tetanus to tumors, from headaches to hair loss. The first apothecary shops were founded during the Middle Ages in Baghdad (8th century).

### 16th Century: Pharmaceutical Science
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.

Pharmaceutical science emerged as a science in the 16th century. The Swiss physician-chemist Paracelsus advocated to abandon the illusive quest of gold by alchemy and to use chemistry for the preparation of medicines. The first pharmacopoeia appeared in Germany in 1542 with an inventory of drugs with instructions on their use and preparation.

### 16th Century: Maritime Routes to India and America

Further to the discovery of new maritime routes to India and America new substances such as tea, coffee, cacao, spices and other medicines as quinquina and ipecac were introduced in Europe in the 16<sup>th</sup> and the 17<sup>th</sup> centuries; they opened a new era in drug therapy.

### 18th Century: First Vaccine

In 1796 the English surgeon Edward Jenner conceived the concept of vaccination by observing that dairymaids seemed to have immunity to smallpox. He used the cowpox virus to test the idea and the trial proved to be successful: the principle of vaccination was born. The idea was exploited ninety years later by Louis Pasteur for the development of rabies vaccine; these were a major breakthrough in the fight against these new types of diseases.

### 19th Century: Drug Administration

It was not always clearly understood how medications must be delivered in order to be effective. Apothecaries made pills that were designed to be swallowed, pass through the gastrointestinal tract, be retrieved from the stool, and used again. However, it was found that not all drugs could be absorbed into the body from the gastrointestinal tract. Other routes of delivery were searched where drugs could be injected directly into the bloodstream; this led to the design in 1853 by the French surgeon Charles Gabriel Pravaz of the hollow hypodermic needle that was first tested on dogs. These discoveries were of great significance and represent the first steps in drug dosage and administration.

### 19th Century: Isolation of Compounds

The 19<sup>th</sup> century was the time of characterization of natural products by breaking them down into simpler components. It was also the "organic synthesis" time aiming to transform and synthesize organic compounds. Synthetic chemistry enabled the discovery of many therapeutic agents such as chloral, chloroform, aspirin, salicylates and quinine.

### 19th Century: Relief of Pain in Surgical Operations

Pain relief has been a priority for surgeons, and the discovery of ether in 1842 and chloroform in 1847 as anesthetics enabled them to take pride in the speed they could do a surgical operation. This also helped to reduce the fear and anxiety of the patients.

### 19th Century: New Classes of Drugs

Phenol started to be used as an anti-infective agent in the prevention of infectious diseases and chloral hydrate was introduced and became the first synthetic sedative-hypnotic drug. Nitroglycerin was found as a relaxant agent (it was later found that this class of organic nitrates are also useful in the treatment of heart problems). A number of new agents were introduced during this period as for example acetanilide (analgesic-antipyretic), the artificial sweetener saccharin and benzocaine (the first of many local anesthetics).

### 20th Century: Pioneer Work of Paul Ehrlich
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer

Following an outstanding pioneer approach Paul Ehrlich developed in 1910 Arsphenamine for the treatment of syphilis. This was the first drug synthesized to kill a specific invading microorganism. Ehrlich was the first who synthesized and tested a large number of compounds to find the most effective molecule. This screening approach remains one of the most important methods used by the pharmaceutical industry to discover new drugs.

### 20th Century: Sulfonamide Antibacterial Dyes

In the 1930's, it was found that diazo dyes containing sulfonamide groups were effective in treating streptococcal infections in mice. The first one was developed as antibacterial agent and is known as Prontosil. Many sulfonamide analogs were then synthesized and tested for their biological activities.

### 20th Century: Recognition of Vitamins

Vitamins are necessary for body metabolism and must be provided from the diet. Most of the vitamin deficiency disorders were proven in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. An example proving their importance is the dramatic story of the Japanese sailors who suffered from the terrible *beriberi* disease. Japanese sailors main diet consisted of polished white rice, which is very poor in thiamine (vitamin B1). The preliminary polishing treatment of the white rice removed the important thiamine, a molecule required for glucose metabolism and for construction of neuron membranes, among other functions.

### 20th Century: The Antibiotic Era

Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928 but he was unable to prepare enough material to carry out human trials. The discovery remained a laboratory curiosity. Ten years later Florey and Chain at Oxford University purified penicillin in sufficient quantity to collect new evidence on the remarkable power of the molecule and to prove its value as a drug. They imagined the setup of a series of small factories in UK for the production of the molecule but finally in the early 1940s, they sought help in America.

### 20th Century: Pfizer Management Decision

Florey played a crucial role in convincing the US pharmaceutical companies to undertake the large-scale production of penicillin. The project was very risky; however Pfizer's management took the leap and voted the investment of millions of dollars to buy the equipment and facilities needed for the mass production.

### 20th Century: Large Scale Production of Penicillin

Pfizer succeeded to develop a process for producing penicillin based on deep tank fermentation techniques, a process which was shared with 19 other US pharmaceutical companies. Looking for massive quantities to support the war effort, the U.S. government financed the project and soon Pfizer was producing five times more penicillin than originally anticipated. The drug started to be used by the Allied forces in Normandy in 1944 and for the rest of the war; it contributed saving countless lives.

### 20th Century: Antibacterial Agents Isolated from Plants

An important era of antibiotic discovery took place in the mid 20th century; a great number of antibacterial agents were isolated from plants as for example streptomycin, choramphenicol and tetracyclines. In particular the American biochemist Selman Abraham Waksman (1888-1973) contributed to the discovery of Streptomycin and over twenty other antibiotics - a word which he coined.

### 20th Century: Discovery of Adrenal Cortex Hormones

In the 1930's Edward Calvin Kendall discovered the adrenal cortex hormones and was awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine. He isolated the adrenal cortex hormones and demonstrated their structures, and their functions. Lew Sarett designed at Merck &#38; Co. a practical synthesis of Cortisone and the molecule was first produced commercially in 1949.

### 20th Century: NSAIDs

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are analgesic drugs that were discovered in the 1960s and represent a major breakthrough in drug discovery. This is a new class of drugs that relief pain and reduce inflammation. Aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and voltaren are examples of members of this class. Most of them share the common phenyl-acetic-acid motif.

#### Example-1 of Project: Factor Xa

Factor Xa plays a critical role in the coagulation cascade; its inhibition is expected to lead to antithrombotic agents. New drugs were searched by targeting inhibition of this protein and the design strategy was done based on its 3D structure. This led to the discovery of a new and potent Factor Xa inhibitors such as the molecule shown below.

In the mid 1990's pharmaceutical companies searched for a new class of anti-inflammatory agents termed COX-2 inhibitors expected to have advantages over conventional non-selective COX inhibitors (NSAIDs) since the gastrointestinal effects such as ulceration, and internal bleeds are mediated by COX-1. In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Vioxx that became a blockbuster with annual sales over $ 2 billions. In 2004 Vioxx was withdrawn from the market due to increased risk of heart attack and stroke.

### 20th Century: From Apothecaries to Factories
*[Apo]: 3D structure of a macromolecule without a ligand

Major pharmaceutical companies were founded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; they gradually superseded the traditional compounding of medications by individuals. For example, in the Upper Rhine Valley near Basel, Switzerland new factories produced dyestuffs with antiseptic properties. Some of the leading pharmaceutical companies, including Hoffman-La-Roche, Sandoz, Ciba-Geigy and, later, Novartis were founded in this region.

## Revolutions that Changed Drug Discovery

### Major Achievements

What changes gave a new dimension to today's drug discovery ? We present most important of them in the following pages.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/drug-discovery/dd_few.png){: loading=lazy }
### Understanding Drug-Receptor Recognition

A concept of great importance reveals why and how the interaction of a drug with its receptor depends on the exact 3D features of the two molecules. This principle proved to be of central importance in drug discovery for understanding the origin of a disease at the molecular level and a key for developing new drugs.

### Recombinant Technologies and Cloning of Genes

In the 1990's recombinant technology created the biotechnology industry. It enabled the X-ray determination of key protein structures and began to play a concrete therapeutic role in enabling structure-based design to be exploited in drug discovery. The principle is to insert the DNA from any source into bacteria and to express the corresponding gene in these cells. Somatostatin was the first human protein made using this technology.

A medication administered intravenously, is 100% bioavailable; however, when it is administered via other routes such as orally, its bioavailability decreases due to incomplete absorption. Oral drugs have to pass through the liver before they can circulate in the blood stream; also the blood-brain barrier prevents many drugs from reaching the brain. Poor bioavailability is very often associated with poor water solubility and the ability for a drug to penetrate membranes is mainly governed by its lipid solubility (and molecular weight).

#### Toxicity

Toxicity is the degree to which a drug is able to damage the exposed patient; every drug has toxicity at sufficient dose. Therapeutic ratio is the efficacious dose vs. the toxic dose. Several types of drug toxicities that need to be under control in drug discovery are presented and discussed in the other chapters of this course.

##### Protection of Drug Discovery Achievements

R&#38;D based pharmaceutical companies must protect their drug discoveries. Molecules or classes of molecules, formulations containing the molecule(s), process for making the compound, intermediates involved in the process, and uses of the compound(s) for the treatment of a particular disease must be claimed in a patent to protect the discovery. Only through patent protection can the company hope to earn enough to recoup their R&#38;D investment.

##### Lifetime and Effective Lifetime of a Patent

Drug discovery plays a pivotal role in contributing to the extension of the patents of the company. Patent extension is vitally important in the pharmaceutical industry because by the time a drug is marketed as much as 12 years of patent protection may have elapsed. This means that without extension the effective patent term is only 8 years. For example, a new formulation can be used to obtain a patent extension.

##### Assessing Patentability: The Viagra-Levitra Example

Drug discovery plays an important role in a pharmaceutical company for assessing the patentability of a molecule conceived on the basis of one its competitors. In the example below drug discovery scientists of Bayer-GSK estimated that Levitra would not be considered as an infringement on the Viagra patent. Indeed, Pfizer sued Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline for infringement on their patent and the case failed both in Europe and in the USA.

### Drug Discovery before and after 1980

Up to the 1980's drug discovery was mainly driven by a collaboration between medicinal chemists and biologists. All other disciplines supported the research team with experts contributing as consultants rather than full members of the core drug discovery research unit. In the mid 1980's the situation changed in many companies and the molecular modeler started to be a full member of the core research team.

### Intelligent Management Strategy

The success of modern drug discovery teams is the result of an intelligent management strategy promoting the integration of the different specialists involved in a project. Before 1980 drug discovery was conducted by individuals resulting in almost random discoveries. After the 1990's the different experts learned to work together in a concerted manner. The principles of rational drug design are presented in the next section.

## Rational Drug Design Strategy

### Two Major Approaches

Rational drug design is based on a molecular understanding of the interactions between the drug and its target in biological systems. When the 3D structure of the target protein is known, this information can be exploited for the design of new ligands. When the three-dimensional structure of the target protein is not available, one can exploit the information provided by known active molecules. The interaction with the target protein remains the central issue, however the design is made indirectly.

#### Underlying Principles

Structure-based drug design exploits the detailed 3D recognition features between a ligand and its receptor, and the underlying concept is "molecular complementarity". Ligand-based drug design exploits the likeness between molecules that is expressed in terms of the concept of "3D molecular similarity".

### Contribution of Molecular Modeling
*[Molecular Modeling]: A field that models molecular behavior with theoretical methods and computational techniques.

Computer modeling has greatly contributed to the success of rational drug design technologies in drug discovery. It helped to motivate the research teams and to reduce the number of molecules to synthesize in order to find a lead compound. Success stories cannot be anymore presented in one single review because of the great number of examples.

### The Molecular Similarity Principle

In drug discovery the "molecular similarity principle" is the underlying concept of virtually all ligand-based drug design methods. It assumes that similar molecules tend to behave similarly, while more dissimilar molecules exhibit more distinct properties.

### The Molecular Complementarity

When the 3D structure of the target protein is available, the molecular complementarity can be easily seen. The principal forces involved upon the binding of a ligand to a biological system are: hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding and electrostatic forces. Energy dictates molecular associations between a protein and a ligand and controls all these interactions: they are exploited in drug discovery to maximize the binding of a candidate molecule.

### Structure-Based Drug Discovery: The Aliskiren Example

With the aim of developing develop an antihypertensive drug acting as renin inhibitor Novartis used a 3D homology model of the enzyme to predict the binding mode of a potent reference peptide. This complex served as a basis for the design of orally available non-peptidic inhibitors. This led to the discovery of Aliskiren (Tekturna), a drug now used for the treatment of high blood pressure. Molecular modeling played a central role in the discovery and development of this drug for which the team received the prize "2009 Heroes in Chemistry" from the American Chemical Society.

### Therapeutic Risk in a Project

Drug discovery is driven by innovation and competition. Some projects are very risky because the corresponding target remains to be validated. Less risky projects are those based on the copy of an existing drug having a validated target. From the managerial point of view both approaches remain valid and in both cases scientists involved in drug discovery know exactly what to do.

## The Major Players in Drug Research

### Role of Each Scientist

Drug discovery develops within a mutidisciplinary framework. Some of the tasks of the major players done by each scientist in drug research are presented here. The list is far from being exhaustive, it just intends to provide some familiarity with the everyday activity of each of these experts. Note that, in small groups, many of these functions may be assumed by the same scientist.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/drug-discovery/dd_role.png){: loading=lazy }
### Organic Chemist

The organic chemist is often the project leader of a drug discovery project. The major roles of the organic chemist include the following: prepare new molecules, analyze the SAR data, order new molecules, design a library of molecules, scale up a chemical synthesis.
*[SAR]: Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR) is the analysis of the relationships between chemical structure and biological activity.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/drug-discovery/dd_organic.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Prepare new Molecules

In the first place the organic chemist prepares new molecules. He must find the best synthetic scheme to achieve this goal as quickly as possible. When they are ready, the molecules are sent to the biologists for biological testing.

#### Scale Up a Chemical Synthesis

When a lead candidate or a candidate drug has been identified, the organic chemist works to scale up the synthesis. He modifies the synthetic scheme or the reagents to reduce the costs of the preparation and tries to increase the effectiveness of a given step by changing some of the experimental conditions such as the reagents, the temperature, the time or the catalysts.

#### Test New Molecules

In the first place the biologists test molecules given to them by the chemists. The tests can be performed *in-vivo* or *in-vitro*. *In-vivo* tests use a whole living organism, whereas *in-vitro* tests are performed in a controlled environment, such as in a test tube or Petri dish. The results are generally given as a structure-activity table showing the molecules and their biological activities.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/drug-discovery/dd_testnm.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Compare Results Obtained by Other Groups

Whenever possible, biologists compare the results obtained with their biological tests with the values obtained by other groups, on a given molecule. Availability of similar molecules in a given class is a great help allowing risk to be more objectively compared.

His major role includes the following: use a variety of computer graphics and computational tools to build structure-activity models, provide structural models of good quality, analyze and suggest candidate molecules, assess molecules submitted by the team, explore ways for 3D alignment of molecules.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/drug-discovery/dd_modeler0.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Provide Structural Models of Good Quality

The first issue in a project consists of having a good model of the target protein, of complexes with other molecules (substrate, molecules of the competitors ...). The models created by the molecular modeler are communicated to the members of the research team. They can analyze them on their computer and explore new ideas for designing other molecules.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/drug-discovery/dd_give_good.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Analyze and Suggest Candidate Molecules

Most of the time the molecular modeler analyzes alone the molecular structures and explore how they may be exploited. Regular meetings are then organized with the members of the research team where the modeler shows his results, discuss possibilities and decide with the team what should be done next, until another session takes place to move forward in the project.

#### Assess Molecules Submitted the Team

Molecules are submitted by the team to the modeler for considering their validity according to the desired 3D requirements. When the molecules do not conform to these requirements and taking into consideration that the chemist knows how to synthesize such products, the modeler looks for structural modifications that may lead likely bio-active structures.

#### Explore Ways for 3D Alignment of Molecules

When two molecules have similiar biological properties and are chemically unrelated, it is not always easy to find their common 3D features. The molecular modeler analyzes the conformational posibilities of the molecules considered and then searches for ways to align them in 3D.

### Biophysicist

A biophysicist can be expert in X-Ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy or in cryo-electron microscopy. Each field is generally managed by a different person but they all contribute to the establisment of 3D models of the proteins involved in drug discovery projects.

#### X-Ray Crystallographer

The major roles of the X-Ray crystallographer include the following: prepare crystals of a protein or a complex with a protein, measure diffraction pattern and density maps, fit the electron density map, refine the 3D atomic model.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/drug-discovery/dd_overv_xrays2.png){: loading=lazy }
##### Prepare Crystals of a Protein or a Complex

Preparing protein crystals suitable for structural analysis is currently the bottleneck in structure determination by X-ray crystallography. One method used by the X-Ray Crystallographer is to start by getting few crystals to grow in the highly supersaturated solution. Then the crystals are exposed to a less saturated solution so they can grow. This is done either by moving the crystals or changing the saturation of the solution.

##### Diffraction Pattern and Density Map

Electron density map construction requires 3D Fourier transformation computations and the resolution of the so-called "phase problem". This step is done by the X-Ray crystallographer.

##### Refine the 3D Atomic Model

The crystallographer aims at maximizimg the correlation between the diffraction data and the current model. This is an iterative process and the agreement is measured by the so-called "R-factor". When convergence is achieved the crystal structure can be considered as solved.

#### NMR Spectroscopist
*[NMR]: An analytical method that allows the spectroscopic detection of structural information of molecules. It requires the application of a strong magnetic field.

The major roles of the NMR Spectroscopist are similar to those of the X-Ray crystallographer. Contrary to X-Ray crystallography, the NMR structure determination is made in solution. The spectroscopist role includes the following: prepare a solution of the protein or a complex, collect and analyze the chemical shifts, construct a preliminary model that fit the chemical shifts and refine the 3D atomic model resulting in a set of plausible conformers.

## Chemistry in Drug Discovery

### Chemistry in Drug Discovery

Chemistry plays a central role because of its ability to create and produce molecules for drug discovery. The chemist is one of the main drivers of the drug discovery process.

### Synthesis of Complicated Molecules

Complicated natural molecules can be prepared by total synthesis, and this is of great importance in drug discovery. Synthetic chemistry opened the way of making by total synthesis molecules that are found in nature only in small quantities, but it also opened the possibility of making analogs of these natural compounds to find those with the most interesting biological potential.

#### Classical Drug Discovery

The classical method consists of the preparation of a single molecule. Whatever synthetic scheme he considers, the chemist aims at the preparation of one well-defined compound from a few milligrams to a few grams of the target substance. The purified molecule is then tested by the biologist.

#### Parallel Drug Discovery

Recent developments in robotics for synthetic chemistry allow the automated preparation of many compounds involving different reactions "in parallel". The biological tests are made either on purified compounds or on mixtures.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/drug-discovery/x.jpg){: loading=lazy }

#### Combinatorial Drug Discovery

Many analogs of a given scaffold can be synthesized with combinatorial chemistry. One part of a molecule is maintained, as different chemical groups are attached to its molecular framework to produce a series of similar molecules. Only a few milligrams of compounds can be obtained by this method, however this is generally sufficient for primary biological screening.

### Chemistry in Lead Discovery

Not all lead molecules ultimately become drugs. Medicinal chemistry is fully exploited to transform a "hit" with poor activities into a lead drug candidate, and this is one of the most important aspect of drug discovery.

#### Protein Kinase Example

The following example illustrates an effort undertaken in the research of inhibitors of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine protein kinase for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and the optimization of a compound by screening. The chemistry program revealed the importance of the substitution (in the meta position) of the phenyl ring, which greatly influenced the potency and the selectivity of the analogs.

## The Present and Future Face of Drug Discovery

### Outsourcing: an Important Cultural Shift

Pharmaceutical companies are currently outsourcing about one fourth of their R&#38;D expenses. It spans the entire R&#38;D activity from combinatorial chemistry to clinical trials. This important cultural shift proved to reduce the heavy investment in infrastructure which would normally be necessary for the company.

![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/drug-discovery/dd_outsrc2.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Why Outsourcing Develops so Well?

Company mergers and acquisitions have slowed decision-making and delayed many important mechanisms in the pharmaceutical companies. This prompted pharma management to intensify clinical trial outsourcing to compensate for this lack of efficiency.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/drug-discovery/dd_outsrc.png){: loading=lazy }
### Management Response to Challenging Situations

A number of important issues have great impact on the way that drug discovery develops in a pharma company. There is a lot of strain on the management of a company for maintaining the drug portfolios. Pharmaceutical companies have to be prepared to tell what to do when disaster strikes, when a new area must be developed, when a patent expires, when an acquisition must be made, when a late stage failure occurs.

### Mergers and Mega-Mergers

Experience shows that reliance on known therapeutic agents and serendipity are no longer sufficient to provide a steady pipeline. Pharmaceutical companies find it difficult to sustain desired revenue growth rates. Blockbuster expirations exert intense pressure on them. Mergers or acquisitions is the approach used to overcome some of the difficulties.

Speedel was a Swiss-based biotech development company created in 1998 by former coworkers of Novartis (Ciba-Geigy). The renin inhibitor Aliskiren was out-licenced by Novartis in 1999 to Speedel who carried out the Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Further to the good results obtained, Novartis exercised its call-back option and took over the subsequent development of Aliskiren (2002). The molecule was commercialized in 2007 and finally, Novartis acquired the entire Speedel company (2008).
