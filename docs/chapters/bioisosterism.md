    The concept of bioisosterism is presented and put in perspective from the early ideas of Langmuir to the modern bioinformatics era. Because of its fuzziness the concept can be used in medicinal chemistry for many purposes and this is extensively presented and illustrated in this chapter. Patent issues associated with bioisosterism are discussed; programs and databases that have been developed for bioisoteric replacement are reviewed.

## Introduction

### What is Bioisosterism?
*[Bioisosterism]: The transformation of a molecule by the exchange of a group of atoms with another and having similar biological properties to the parent compound.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='bioisosterism/what-is-bioisosterism-5b65d7e0'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The principle that similar molecules tend to have similar properties has been around since the early days of medicinal chemistry. Bioisosterism,  a concept based on this principle,   makes it possible to  replace fragments of a compound by groups having similar properties. The modified analog is then tested for interesting properties. The example below  illustrates two bioisosteric anxiolitic drugs: Diazepam and Clobazam. Clobazam was found to be more effective than diazepam in diminishing anxiety.

### History of the Concept of Bioisosterism
*[Bioisosterism]: The transformation of a molecule by the exchange of a group of atoms with another and having similar biological properties to the parent compound.
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='bioisosterism/history-concept-bioisosterism-ac62ec11'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Over the years the concept of bioisosterism has progressively evolved. In 1919 Langmuir  introduced the concept of isosterism that  only took physicochemical properties into account. Later the biological dimension was included that turned the original isosterism into bioisosterism. Recent progress has given a new dimension to bioisosterism and has made it an integral part of cheminformatics today. The key  phases in the development of bioisosterism appear in the following diagram and are presented in the following pages.

He suggested that molecules or groups of atoms that have the same number of electrons may possess similar physicochemical properties. He was able to identify 21 groups of isosteres some of which are shown below.

### Friedman (1951): Concept of Bioisosteres
*[Bioisostere]: A compound resulting from the exchange of a group of atoms with another and having similar biological properties to the parent compound.
*[Bioisosteres]: A compound resulting from the exchange of a group of atoms with another and having similar biological properties to the parent compound.

Similar compounds with opposite biological activities (e.g. agonist/antagonist) are also considered bioisosteres.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='bioisosterism/burger-1991-c2dbc359'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Burger modified somewhat Friedman's definition of bioisosteres defining them as molecules or groups of atoms that possess similar molecular shapes and volumes, approximately the same distribution of electrons, and exhibit similar physical properties. This definition proved to be of great utility to the medicinal chemist because of - rather than despite - its fuzziness. 
*[bioisostere]: A compound resulting from the exchange of a group of atoms with another and having similar biological properties to the parent compound.
*[bioisosteres]: A compound resulting from the exchange of a group of atoms with another and having similar biological properties to the parent compound.

### A Simple Concept for Many Applications

As shown in the list below, the needs of chemists can be very different. However, due to its simplicity, bioisosterism provides a simple and creative way to address all these in a constructive manner as is illustrated in the following pages.

### Change the Type of Biological Activity

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='bioisosterism/change-type-biological-activity-06778dc1'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In some cases the medicinal chemist does not know exactly what he is looking for. His synthetic program is then based on the modification of the structure of an active compound, with the hope of finding new analogs with unexpected biological profiles. In the following pages we present three examples to illustrate how bioisosterism can guide this type of approach.
*[analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold
*[analogs]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold
*[bioisosterism]: The transformation of a molecule by the exchange of a group of atoms with another and having similar biological properties to the parent compound.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='bioisosterism/example-1-tricyclic-structures-369515e9'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Simple bioisosteric modifications of the phenothiazine structure proved to be a rich source of useful drugs having completely different modes of action. Starting with antihistaminic drugs such as promethazine, it has been possible to discover bioisostere tranquillizers such as chlorpromazine. Further bioisoteric modifications led to the discovery of antidepressant drugs such as imipramine. Note the different mode of action of these drugs.

In the example below, the carboxylic group of glutamic acid was replaced by a 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole bioisostere, leading to a molecule that is a potent agonist of the central glutamic acid receptor.
*[agonist]: A chemical substance capable of activating a given receptor.
*[bioisostere]: A compound resulting from the exchange of a group of atoms with another and having similar biological properties to the parent compound.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='bioisosterism/organon-ibis-program-0385c461'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Organon has developed an in-house intranet application program called IBIS to search for bioisosteric replacements. Constraints such as LogP and pKa allow for focusing the search. The performance of the method  has been validated using bioisosteric fragment pairs extracted from the BIOSTER database. In the example below are shown bioisosteres of benzamidine.

## Limitations and the Future

### The Receptor is the Ultimate Decider

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='bioisosterism/receptor-is-ultimate-decider-6dd500e8'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In bioisosterism a successful replacement is never guaranteed because the receptor is the ultimate "decider" and this is illustrated here. In the area of &beta;-adrenergic agents it has been proven that the replacement of a phenolic hydroxyl with a sulfonamide group retains the biological activities, and this was attributed to the similar pKa values of the two groups. However for opioid ligands, the same replacement led to inactive molecules.

### Strategic and Financial Considerations

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='bioisosterism/strategic-financial-considerations-27b7dbe6'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Research based on the development of analog compounds is attractive because of the limited risk and also because no important investment is needed in fundamental research. On the other hand, the "me-too" drug will be in competition with the other analogs on the market and the effects that will be observed in the long term are unpredictable; they can be outstanding or catastrophic. Sales of analog drugs are estimated to represent two-thirds of all the small molecules market.
*[analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold
*[analogs]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer

### Examples of Success and Failures

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='bioisosterism/examples-success-failures-1b72f5a2'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Certain drugs that were introduced as a copy of an existing drug eventually became blockbusters and garnered a greater part of the market than the original 'pioneer' drug because of concrete additional advantages. Below are examples of successful drugs and others that failed for the two types of research (place the cursor on the name of each drug to visualize additional information).
