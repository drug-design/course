## ADME/Tox Case Study 1: Identification of Non-Genotoxic Carcinogens
*[ADME]: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion

### Identification of Non-Genotoxic Carcinogens

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='adme-case-studies/identification-non-genotoxic-carcinogens-2287224c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The identification of non-genotoxic carcinogens is an important issue in ADME/Tox analyses; large species differences may occur for sub-sets of compounds. A model addressing this particular issue for both pharmaceutical and chemical compounds was introduced by Walter Westerink and Willem Schoonen at Schering-Plough. This is presented in the following pages.

These carcinogens can bind to two specific classes of nuclear receptors, which are well known as: Arylhydrocarbon Receptor (AhR), and Peroxysomal Proliferator Activating Receptor alpha (PPAR&alpha;).

#### Both Receptors Form Heterodimers

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='adme-case-studies/both-receptors-form-heterodimers-2d9909af'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The Arylhydrocarbon Receptor forms heterodimers with the Arylhydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocation (ARNT) protein, whereas the Peroxysomal Proliferator Activating Receptor alpha forms a heterodimer with the Retinoic acid X Receptor (RXR). Three different RXR forms exist, known as RXR&alpha;, RXR&beta;, and RXR&gamma;. Interaction with all three forms is possible, but RXR&alpha; is most commonly described in this aspect.

### Activation for the Arylhydrocarbon Receptor

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='adme-case-studies/activation-for-arylhydrocarbon-receptor-0fa0adc0'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The mechanisms of activation for the Arylhydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) is as follows: A ligand enters the cell by diffusion and binds to AhR after dissociation of the Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90). This AhR occupied with ligand will pass through the nuclear membrane and forms a heterodimer with the AhR Nuclear Translocation (ARNT) protein. This heterodimer can finally bind to the specific Responsive Element (RE) in the promoter of the target gene and transcribe and translate many enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 variants CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1.

### The Responsive Elements of Interaction (1/2)

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='adme-case-studies/responsive-elements-interaction-12-59d00483'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The responsive elements of AhR and PPAR&alpha; interaction as well as of estrogen (E), glucocorticoid (GT), thyroid hormone (T) and retinoic acid (RA) receptors are known. For interaction of nuclear receptors specific interaction sites exist in the promoter of specific genes. For homo- and heterodimers these sequences exist of 5 to 6 base pairs in an inversed repeat or mirror image. Characteristic examples are shown in the figure below and are explained in the following page.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='adme-case-studies/responsive-elements-interaction-22-c24298c6'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>These 5 to 6 base pairs (in red) are very important for the interaction of the first zinc finger of the nuclear receptor with the DNA. A small change of one of these central base pairs 3 and/or 4 can change the activity from being active for estrogens in becoming active for glucocorticoids. Moreover, the space between the responsive elements is also very important, as shown for ERE and TRE, which contain either 3 different base pairs or none at all. In case of the AhR-RE the outside flanking of the 5 base pairs GCGTG is also very relevant for the recognition of AhR.

### Binding Analysis of the Arylhydrocarbon Receptor (AhR)

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='adme-case-studies/binding-analysis-arylhydrocarbon-receptor-ahr-bab43458'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The most common ligand is identified as dioxin. The chemical catastrophe in Seveso in Italy in the seventies resulted in a large exposure of dioxin. Due to this exposure many people, who came in contact with dioxin, suffered years later from the increases of tumor incidence. When the AhR was identified, assays were developed to measure the exposure towards dioxin. Binding studies with dioxin (TCDD) and 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) are one way to identify this AhR (Riddick et al. 1994). The chemical structures of these ligands are shown on the next page.

The measurements are performed by Q-PCR for several AhR agonists at different concentration levels in human liver hepatocytes in HepG2 cells (Westerink and Schoonen, 2007). If we look at the lowest concentration dependent inductions (Blue), we clearly see that TCDD is the most potent inducer for both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, followed by 3-MC.

Metabolism in humans is mainly by N-glucuronidation of this function rendering the compound much more water soluble. Rodents have very high amidase and esterase levels and the principal metabolites formed are by hydrolysis of the acetyl moiety. The resultant secondary amine renders this metabolite much more basic (and now ionised substantially at physiological pH than the parent ketoconazole, but still with substantial lipophilicity. The combination of lipophilicity and basicity is associated with substantial membrane interactions to the extent that toxicity in the form of phospholipidosis is observed.

#### Origin of the Hepatotoxicity of Procicromil in Dog

Further understanding is provided by considering the structures of proxicromil and its metabolite. The rapid hydroxylation in the liver in rat and man results in lowering the lipophilicity of the molecule and removing its amphipathis nature (detoxification). The hydroxylation is very slow in dog resulting in high concentrations of the detergent like proxicromil compound at the biliary canaliculus within the liver.

They are all slowly hydroxylated in dogs as compared to rat and humans. This results in potentially exaggerated pharmacological and toxicological effects at equivalent doses.

Muscle toxicity (myopathy) is a low incidence adverse effect of statins, the extreme form of which is rhabdomyolysis which can lead to kidney failure and death. Cerivastatin showed rates of rhabdomyolysis up to 10 fold greater than other HMG-CoA inhibitors. The systemic bioavailability was the highest of any statin. Bioavailability in this context could be viewed as a ratio of systemic burden (muscle-toxicity) versus hepatic burden (liver-efficacy) and may point to a key factor that differentiates this drug.

It is probable that the detrimental effects of flosequinan are multifactorial but the drug increased circulating noradrenaline concentrations and heart rate and these may have been contributing factors in the mortality observed.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='adme-case-studies/encainide-cc994a52'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Encainide was an anti-arrhythmic agent which blocked the Na+ channel excitatory current. A major series of studies (CAST) examined whether drugs of this type could prevent sudden death in high-risk patients. These patients had frequent premature ventricular extrasystoles (PVCs) and reduced ventricular function following acute myocardial infarction. The placebo group was found to have lower mortality compared to the group treated with Encainide (and Flecainide). The excess number of new ischemic events in the placebo group equaled the excess number of deaths in the treated group indicating that new ischemia was converted to sudden death.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='adme-case-studies/rofecoxib-86d2a9b4'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Rofecoxib (Vioxx) belongs to the anti-inflammatory class of drugs termed COX-2 inhibitors. These were compounds with advantages over conventional non-selective COX inhibitors (NSAIDs) since the gastrointestinal effects such as ulceration, and internal bleeds are mediated by COX-1. Rofecoxib increased the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events. A pharmacological rationalisation of this effect can be advanced concerning suppression of endothelial vascular PGI2 whilst not inhibiting platelet derived TXA2 production resulting in an imbalance of homeostatic, normally endothelium protective and antithrombotic, mechanisms.

#### Lessons from Withdrawals due to Primary Pharmacology

The obvious reaction of Regulatory Authorities and Pharmaceutical Companies is to study the drug more extensively in Development: "outcomes" trials now form part of Development rather than a post-marketing activity, contributing hugely to the cost of drug development.

##### A Broad Spectrum of Drugs

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='adme-case-studies/broad-spectrum-drugs-e8b54e13'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The period covered (1980 to date) spans "phenomena" type drugs, such as Flosequinan to highly specific selective drugs such as Alosetron. Phenomena drugs do not have a specific target or mechanism. Screening of compounds is normally by pharmacological effect and the drugs therefore may have multiple mechanisms. Although it may be possible to separate the beneficial and deleterious effects, scientifically this is very difficult. This invariably makes the design of newer agents with improved therapeutic ratios almost impossible. Alosetron represents the other extreme where the selectivity is almost absolute and the side effects must be associated with the primary pharmacology.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='adme-case-studies/rapacuronium-f4384e04'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Rapacuronium was introduced as an ultra-short acting nondepolarising neuromuscular blocking agent of nicotinic receptors. The drug was used to facilitate intubation. The drug was withdrawn from clinical use due to a high incidence of bronchospasm, sometimes with lethal consequences. Rapacuronium is an antagonist of M2 muscarinic receptors. Normally the release of acetylcholine is terminated by the feedback of M2 receptors. Selective antagonism of these receptors leads to excessive release of acetylcholine, which can then act on the M3 receptors in airway smooth muscle, causing bronchospasm.

Screens can be configured in high throughput format. Similarly screening for CYP inhibition takes place high in the cascade. Initially most screens examined reversible inhibition, but mechanism based inhibition, of the type seen with mibefradil, is now routinely incorporated. Broad ligand binding is also widely adopted at a later stage in drug discovery.

### Balancing Benefit / Risk

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='adme-case-studies/balancing-benefit-risk-94dda4a9'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>No matter how extensively tested a drug is prior to marketing a full understanding of its benefit / risk can only be approached after perhaps 100,000 patients have received the drug for an extensive period. Even then it is often extremely difficult to balance benefit / risk since in some cases many patients may benefit, but a small subset of patients (perhaps as low as 1 in 30,000) may be harmed.

### Benefit Analyses for Antidepressants

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='adme-case-studies/benefit-analyses-for-antidepressants-5de293e2'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Availability of similar drugs in a class is a great help, as benefit across the class is approximately constant allowing risk to be more objectively compared. In the example below all anti-depressants are associated with a very low but real risk of hepatotoxicity. Nefazodone risk is substantially greater than the other drugs.

### Monitoring

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='adme-case-studies/monitoring-630f020b'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In almost all cases awareness of the risks, by education of physicians and patients and therefore better monitoring would help alleviate the extreme cases, and as in the case of Alosetron allow re-introduction of the drug.
