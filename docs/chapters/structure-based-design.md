## Introduction

### Design of Drug Candidates: An Iterative Process

The design of new ligands is carried out as a step-by-step procedure. The state-of-the art design process is based in large part, on a good understanding of the molecular recognition of protein-ligand complexes relying upon analogies to other systems and using advanced computerized molecular design programs.

### Steps in Structure-Based Drug Design

The steps used in structure-based drug design for designing new lead compounds are illustrated in the following diagram.

### Small Changes Can Produce Huge Effects

When structural changes are made that modify the energy of interaction of a ligand with its receptor, one can observe a large change in the biological properties. For example the SB203580 molecule has a Ki of 100 nM on the protein kinase p38. However the molecule looses its activity if residue Thr-106 is mutated by Met-106. The same molecule is entirely inactive on the kinase ERK2, however if the residue Glu-105 of the protein is mutated by Thr-105, the Ki of the molecule becomes 13 nM. The following pages will provide a 3D interpretation of these observations.

#### p38 Wild

The crystallographic structure of the complex of the inhibitor SB203580 with the p38 kinase reveals good complementary features between the inhibitor and the protein.

#### p38 Mutant

Replacing in the X-ray structure residue Thr-106 by a Met-106 reveals the existence of strong steric repulsions between the mutated protein and SB203580. This explains why SB203580 is not anymore active on the mutated protein.

#### ERK-2 Wild

There is no complex between SB203580 with the wild ERK2 kinase. The following model was constructed using the crystallographic structure of the complex with the ERK2-(Q105T) mutant. It shows strong repulsions between SB203580 and the Glu-105 residue and explains why the compound is inactive on ERK2.

#### ERK-2 Mutant

The crystallographic structure of the complex of SB203580 with the mutated ERK2 (Q105T) kinase reveals favorable interactions between the inhibitor and the protein. This example shows how a single point mutation can transform an inactive molecule into a nanomolar inhibitor. Small structural modifications can greatly affect the potency of an inhibitor, this can be well exploited for achieving potency and specificity.

### Increasing Biological Activity

Each small amount that is gained in the binding energy of a ligand is translated into significant improvements in its biological activity. The following table illustrates the relative values of Kd as a function of the binding energies, at 300&#176;K.

### Beginning the Design Phase

Once the phase of analysis is complete, the design phase can start. One has to identify candidate scaffolds with appropriate substituents that can ensure enhanced interactions with selected sites of the protein. In the case of the optimization of a known series, the information is used to design new analogs.
*[analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold

### A Simple Example of Design

A molecule active at the micromolar range has been discovered and the X-ray structure of the complex of this molecule with the target protein has been solved. Following is an example of analog designed from the X-ray data.

#### Extension of the Molecule to Form another H-Bond

The X-ray structure reveals the binding mode of the micromolar molecule. On the basis of this information one could expect to obtain a more potent compound by making the amino-analog of the molecule. As can be seen on the view, the amino moiety creates hydrogen bonds with two backbone carbonyls of the target protein.

![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/alt1_1_6_2_1.png){: loading=lazy }

#### Checking the Validity of the Design

The next step is to test the biological activity of the molecule to see if the design concept was structurally correct. This information could provide answers to such questions as: If the molecule was potent, was it potent for the correct reasons built into the design? If the compound was weaker than expected, how and why did the concept design fail?

### Definition of Docking

Given the 3D structure of a protein target, compounds can be designed to fit in a cavity, which is called "docking". Starting with an approximate orientation of a ligand into the active site, the docking process modifies its position and conformation in order to have a maximum of favorable intermolecular interactions. The treatment ends when a minimum of energy is obtained for the complex.

### Docking Treatments

Docking treatments are very useful for assessing the quality of candidate prototypes. If the ligand is a known active molecule, docking simulations allow us to identify its bioactive conformation. If the ligand is a candidate molecule, the docking allows us to analyze how it fits to the receptor. The best-docked compounds can be used as leads for further design and optimization.

## Eight Golden Rules

### Eight Golden Rules in Receptor-Based Ligand Design
*[Ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.

Binding efficiency is not only a matter of geometry; the energetics of interactions must be considered. Filling the space in the active site of a protein is a delicate operation. The following examples illustrate some of the important considerations for receptor-based ligand design. Eight rules are presented here.
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/2_1_0_1.png){: loading=lazy }

### Rule 1: Coordinate to Key Anchoring Sites

When working with target proteins, first one has to consider the proper anchorage of the ligand to key elements of the catalytic site. For example the Zinc of a metalloprotein, the Heme of a cytochrome P450 enzyme, the aspartates of an aspartic protease, the oxyanion hole of serine protease.
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/snap_v1_c6_2_2_s1.png){: loading=lazy }

#### Desolvation Upon Binding

This anchorage not only positions the ligand in the active site but also counteracts the effect of de-solvating the two components when binding occurs. This is very important energetically.
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/snap_v1_c6_2_2_s2.png){: loading=lazy }

### Rule 2: Exploit Hydrophobic Interactions

With hydrophobic pockets, placing a hydrophobic surface of the ligand in hydrophobic sites of the target protein provides an important driving force in complex formation because it reduces non-polar surface areas exposed to water. The more water molecules liberated in drug binding, the greater the gain in entropy and therefore the greater the affinity of the drug for the protein.
*[affinity]: The affinity of a ligand is its ability to bind to its biological target.
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/snap_v1_c6_2_3_s1.png){: loading=lazy }

#### Many Small Contributions

Although individually small, the total contribution of hydrophobic bonds to drug-receptor interactions is substantial. Empirical data suggests that the free energy contribution due to hydrophobic bonding is approximately 2.9 kJ/mol per methylene group and 8.4 kJ/mol for a benzene ring. Unlike hydrogen bonds, the hydrophobic interactions are not directional.

### Rule 3: Exploit Hydrogen Bonding Capabilities

Once a new skeleton fills a large portion of the available space, a hydrogen-bonding functionality can be placed to complement those functional groups presented either by the protein or water molecules.
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/snap_v1_c6_2_4.png){: loading=lazy }

#### Hydrogen Bonds with Backbone Atoms

A carbonyl oxygen is optimally satisfied when it accepts two different hydrogen bonds with C=O --- H angles close to 120&#176;. However hydrogen bonds to carbonyl oxygen atoms with a C=O --- H angle close to 180&#176; form the basis for &beta;-sheet formation and are quite favorable.

![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/snap_v1_c6_2_5_s1.png){: loading=lazy }

#### Geometry of a Hydrogen Bond and Solvation Issues

The average N-H --- O angle is about 155&#176;, with 90% lying between 140&#176; and 180&#176;. Almost all protein groups are capable of forming hydrogen bonds like this. Where groups are not explicitly hydrogen bonded, they are probably solvated.

#### Hydrogen Bonds with Residue Atoms

Unsatisfied hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are rarely seen in proteins. A corollary for protein-ligand complexes would be burying potential donors and acceptors without forming a complementary hydrogen bond, this would also be highly unfavorable.

![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/2_6_0_1.png){: loading=lazy }
### Rule 4: Exploit Electrostatic Interactions

The optimization of ligand-protein electrostatics can be achieved by placing a positive charge in close vicinity to an enzyme negative charge. The interaction should be fine tuned by subtle structural modifications.
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/alt1_2_7_0_1.png){: loading=lazy }

### Rule 5: Favor Bioactive Form &#38; Avoid Energy Strain

Conformational energy calculations are performed on each design idea in order to determine the internal penalty required for the new ligand to attain its bioactive binding conformation inside the protein. The internal energy that is required for the small molecule to reach its binding conformation is energy lost in binding.
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.

#### Advantage and Limitation of a Rigid Ligands
*[Ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.
*[Ligands]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.

Restricting the conformation space of an inhibitor can be beneficial to binding when the conformation is biased towards the bioactive conformer. However, if parts of the constricting group generate unfavorable interactions with the protein or induce a non-bioactive conformer, then deleterious effects on binding occur.
*[inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/2_8_2_1.png){: loading=lazy }

### Rule 6: Optimize VDW Contacts and Avoid Bumps

Attractive van der Waals interactions occur over a short distance range and attraction decreases as 1/r<sup>6</sup>. As a result, optimization of attractive van der Waals interactions occurs as the shape of the protein binding site and the shape of the ligand match well. A difference of binding energy of 6.3 kJ/mol corresponds to a 10 fold difference in the biological activities.

#### The Frontier between an Excellent Fit and a Bump 
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer

The frontier between an excellent fit and a bump is sometimes difficult to recognize visually; it has to be assessed with additional calculations or determined experimentally. Note that calculations of steric fit are difficult because of possible flexing motions of the protein backbone and especially the residue side-chains.

![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/alt1_2_9_2_1.png){: loading=lazy }

### Rule 7: Structural Water Molecules and Solvation

Inhibitor design strategies have great potential when they target the displacement of water molecules tightly bound to the protein by incorporating elements of the water molecule within the inhibitor.
*[Inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/2_10_1_1.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Desolvation Energies

Desolvation energies are the "price to be paid" for the ligand to attain its binding conformation inside the protein.
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/2_10_2_1.gif){: loading=lazy }

#### Leave Some Room to Solvate Charged Centers 

When polar charged groups are considered in the design of a ligand, one should leave some room for other water molecules to solvate the charged center (except possibly when a salt bridge is formed).
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/2_10_3_1.gif){: loading=lazy }

### Rule 8: Consider Entropic Effect

A flexible molecule has a better chance of finding an optimal fit into a receptor, but this is achieved at the cost of large conformational entropy. Sufficient conformational rigidity is essential to ensure that the loss of entropy upon ligand binding is acceptable. A rigid molecule has little conformational entropy but is unlikely to fit optimally into the receptor.

![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/internet_v1_c6_2_11.gif){: loading=lazy }

#### Gaining Binding by Reduction of Entropy

Conformational flexibility and the associated free energy of the ligand play an important role in ligand-receptor interactions. An analysis of the contributions of various functional groups to binding demonstrates that each freely rotating bond in a ligand reduces binding free energy by about 2.9 kJ/mol.

#### Example of Ligand Rigidification
*[Ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.

Making a ligand more rigid will lead to enhanced activity if the right conformation is maintained. For example freezing of two rotational degrees of freedom in flexible antiulcer agents in a rigid analog resulted in a 150-fold enhancement in activity.

## The Four Design Methods

### The Four Design Methods

There are four basic methods in receptor-based drug design: analog design, database searching, computerized de novo design and manual design.

## Analog Design

### Principles of Analog Design
*[Analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold

In analog design, chemically related molecules are synthesized and tested in order to collect useful data on the structural requirements for the biological activities. In structure-based drug design the structure-activity relationships (SAR) are analyzed in 3D; for example a loss in potency is interpreted as a loss of good complementary between the ligand and the receptor.

### Additional Binding with Arginine Residue

The analysis indicated that a carboxyl function introduced in the chemical structure of trimethoprim could form an ionic linkage with the arginine residue. The carboxyl analog proved to be significantly more potent than the reference trimethoprim and its X-ray structure confirmed the validity of this finding.

## Database Searching

### 3D Database Searching

It is sometimes a challenge to design de novo leads on the basis of an unliganded protein structure alone. In practice the database approach provides an easy way to arrive at leads. It consists of a 3D computerized search of a database of synthesized or naturally occurring compounds and testing them in silico. In this process each candidate molecule is automatically inserted, oriented and minimized into the active site.
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.
*[in silico]: means using silicon-based computer technologies to perform simulations, modeling and experiments

### Scoring the Hits

The result of this treatment is a list of compounds ranked by a score based on the overall match with the receptor.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/5_1_2_1.png){: loading=lazy }
### Advantages of Database Searching

An advantage of this method is that it generally does not require special synthetic efforts (the molecule is available) but on the other hand it is highly dependent on the content of the database and also it is time-consuming.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/structure-based-design/5_2_0_1.gif){: loading=lazy }

### Problems of Conformational Complexity

Due to the conformational complexity of the current molecules, only a few of their conformations are actually stored in the databank. Unless complicated conformational generators are incorporated in the calculations, database searching cannot be exhaustive and therefore many molecules may be overlooked in the process.

### Assessing the Validity of the 3D Structures

Whenever results are obtained from a database search, one should always be critical and check the validity of the result, especially its geometry. For example, using a query consisting of 4 phenyl rings and one OH group, the following search result was obtained. Although geometrically correct, the conformation of the result with all the substituents in the axial orientation is highly unrealistic (too high energy).

### Example of Database Searching

In order to identify small molecules that are complementary in shape to the active site of HIV-1 protease, the 3D structure of the enzyme was used as a screen. The following benzophenone derivative was found as an HIV-1 inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub> = 11 mM).

Subsequent X-ray crystallographic studies revealed that the structure was not binding in the catalytic site as foreseen initially, but in another region 5 &#8491; away and rotated by 80&#176; from the orientation predicted in the computational search; the Haloperidol analog is represented here in yellow. It was expected to interact in the region occupied by known inhibitors, as for example MVT-101 represented in pink.

### Databases of Molecules in 3D

Throughout the world there are thousands of chemical suppliers offering more than 3 million of organic molecules. The advantage of using commercially available molecules in database searching is that they offer a great diversity and can be purchased and tested rapidly. The 3D structures of molecules are either obtained experimentally (X-ray data, NMR) or by modeling techniques.
*[NMR]: An analytical method that allows the spectroscopic detection of structural information of molecules. It requires the application of a strong magnetic field.

### The Main Purpose of a 3D-Database Search

The main purpose of a 3D-database search is not to find compounds with ultrapotent activities. A realistic goal of a 3D-database search should be the discovery of active search results, which can subsequently be used as the basis for further synthetic modifications.

## De-Novo Design

### Automated Construction Approaches

The purpose of construction programs is to discover a new chemical framework that fits to the active site of the target receptor or enzyme. Some methods are based on an existing moiety and additional fragments are appended by a step-by-step build up procedure. Other methods consist of assembling novel molecules from pieces that are positioned optimally in favorable regions of the active site.

## Manual Design

### Manual Design

It is a major challenge to design de novo leads on the basis of an unliganded protein structure alone. However manual design is greatly facilitated by starting from an existing "solution" which consists of the visualization of a complex (an experimental result or a model). This procedure is currently undertaken either by the medicinal chemist or the molecular modeler.
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.

### Importance of Visualization
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.

In manual design the visualization is of central importance. It helps to see in a condensed way the molecular objects. In addition, it triggers the synergy between knowledge and intuition for identifying key features of the receptor pocket or for building molecules under given requirements.

### Tools in Manual Design

Real time rotations, molecular editing functions such as deletion, addition, fusion, connections, torsion angle alterations, superimpositions, coloring and stereo constitute the minimum necessary for sketching and assessing the validity of a solution considered in manual design. On a higher level, the energy calculations and minimizations can complete the panoply of the synthetic chemist.

### Fully Exploiting the Fruits of the Analyses

Manual design aims at the rapid exploitation of the information revealed by molecules previously tested and the translation of this knowledge into the structure of a new molecule to be synthesized. In this example, the analyses of known active molecules indicated the existence of two hydrogen bonds as indicated in the view. However only one hydrogen bond is exploited by the known molecules.

The designed keto molecule incorporates knowledge extracted from the two other active phenyl-imidazole analogs. The imidazole ring of each of the compounds is mimicked by a pyridine ring in the designed structure. The resulting compound proved to be much more potent than the other two compounds.

## Another Iteration

### Another Round of Analysis &#38; Design

The new biological results, the availability of a new X-ray structure, the improved understanding of structure-activity relationships, the optimization of a series, and the need for an entirely new chemical structure are all reasons for the medicinal chemist to return to the "analysis" or "design" modes. The information is used as the basis for another round of analysis, design, synthesis and compound testing.

## A Success Story

### Example of Successful Structure-Based Design

The use of the crystallographic structure of the HIV-1 protease in drug design represents one of the more impressive success stories in the structure-based drug design field. Based on the structure of the protein, many groups have used an iterative structure-based design process. This has resulted in the identification of distinct classes of inhibitors and several successful drug candidates have emerged from these studies and are used in the control of AIDS.

### Mechanism of Action of the HIV-1 Protease

The HIV-1 protease plays a crucial part in the life cycle of the HIV virus. The task of the HIV-1 protease is to cut this long 'polyprotein' into the proper protein-sized pieces. As a result of this crucial task, HIV-1 protease is an excellent target for drug therapy. Inhibitor drugs block the action of the protease and the virus perishes because it is unable to mature into its infectious form.

### A Drug Design Solution Using Database Searching

In order to improve the bioavailability of the inhibitors a data-base approach was considered. Based on the docked A77003 diol/HIV-1 protease complex, a simple pharmacophore was defined by the intramolecular distances between the symmetric hydrophobic groups (P1 and P1') and a hydrogen bond donor/acceptor group bound to the catalytic aspartates.

### Lessons From HIV-1 Protease Inhibition

The key learnings acquired in the course of this study are as follows: (1) the project took advantage of previous knowledge of other projects (renin inhibition; renin is an aspartic protease); (2) medicinal chemistry played a pivotal role in bringing data of high informational content at the beginning of the project and in enabling the design of tailor-made structures that were relatively easy to synthesize; (3) X-ray crystallography played a key role in revealing the structural features of the enzyme and the binding modes of the inhibitor. This allowed efficient design of non-peptidic structures and the rapid optimization of the lead compounds; (4) database searching provided an intermediate molecule with information of high informational content. Finally it paved the way for other projects to aim at converting the knowledge of a substrate or a peptide inhibitor into the structure of a non-peptidic drug.

## Conclusion

### Conclusion

The molecular recognition of protein-ligand complexes is highly complex and the utilization of an iterative design process has greatly advanced the use of protein structure for the design of drug candidates. The state-of-the-art design process relies, in a large part, on a qualitative understanding of the molecular recognition of protein-ligand complexes based upon analogies to other systems and the use of several methods in parallel.
