### Design of Drug Candidates: An Iterative Process

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='structure-based-design/design-drug-candidates-an-iterative-process-81cbcfa6'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The design of new ligands is carried out as a step-by-step procedure. The state-of-the art design process is based in large part, on a good understanding of the molecular recognition of protein-ligand complexes relying upon analogies to other systems and using advanced computerized molecular design programs.

### Small Changes Can Produce Huge Effects

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='structure-based-design/small-changes-can-produce-huge-effects-90bacd6e'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>When structural changes are made that modify the energy of interaction of a ligand with its receptor, one can observe a large change in the biological properties. For example the SB203580 molecule has a Ki of 100 nM on the protein kinase p38. However the molecule looses its activity if residue Thr-106 is mutated by Met-106. The same molecule is entirely inactive on the kinase ERK2, however if the residue Glu-105 of the protein is mutated by Thr-105, the Ki of the molecule becomes 13 nM. The following pages will provide a 3D interpretation of these observations.

### Definition of Docking

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='structure-based-design/definition-docking-f98b0f5c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Given the 3D structure of a protein target, compounds can be designed to fit in a cavity, which is called "docking". Starting with an approximate orientation of a ligand into the active site, the docking process modifies its position and conformation in order to have a maximum of favorable intermolecular interactions. The treatment ends when a minimum of energy is obtained for the complex.

### Docking Treatments

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='structure-based-design/docking-treatments-663627e2'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Docking treatments are very useful for assessing the quality of candidate prototypes. If the ligand is a known active molecule, docking simulations allow us to identify its bioactive conformation. If the ligand is a candidate molecule, the docking allows us to analyze how it fits to the receptor. The best-docked compounds can be used as leads for further design and optimization.
*[bioactive conformation]: The geometry adopted by a ligand when it binds to its biological target.

## Eight Golden Rules

### Eight Golden Rules in Receptor-Based Ligand Design
*[Ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.

Filling the space in the active site of a protein is a delicate operation. The following examples illustrate some of the important considerations for receptor-based ligand design. Eight rules are presented here.

### Rule 1: Coordinate to Key Anchoring Sites

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='structure-based-design/rule-1-coordinate-to-key-anchoring-sites-9b4f069f'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>When working with target proteins, first one has to consider the proper anchorage of the ligand to key elements of the catalytic site. For example the Zinc of a metalloprotein, the Heme of a cytochrome P450 enzyme, the aspartates of an aspartic protease, the oxyanion hole of serine protease.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='structure-based-design/desolvation-upon-binding-3bb107b0'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>This anchorage not only positions the ligand in the active site but also counteracts the effect of de-solvating the two components when binding occurs. This is very important energetically.

### Rule 2: Exploit Hydrophobic Interactions

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='structure-based-design/rule-2-exploit-hydrophobic-interactions-b0467cfe'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>With hydrophobic pockets, placing a hydrophobic surface of the ligand in hydrophobic sites of the target protein provides an important driving force in complex formation because it reduces non-polar surface areas exposed to water. The more water molecules liberated in drug binding, the greater the gain in entropy and therefore the greater the affinity of the drug for the protein.
*[affinity]: The affinity of a ligand is its ability to bind to its biological target.
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='structure-based-design/many-small-contributions-690fd59c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Although individually small, the total contribution of hydrophobic bonds to drug-receptor interactions is substantial. Empirical data suggests that the free energy contribution due to hydrophobic bonding is approximately 2.9 kJ/mol per methylene group and 8.4 kJ/mol for a benzene ring. Unlike hydrogen bonds, the hydrophobic interactions are not directional.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='structure-based-design/hydrogen-bonds-backbone-atoms-765727ac'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>A carbonyl oxygen is optimally satisfied when it accepts two different hydrogen bonds with C=O --- H angles close to 120&#176;. However hydrogen bonds to carbonyl oxygen atoms with a C=O --- H angle close to 180&#176; form the basis for &beta;-sheet formation and are quite favorable.

Almost all protein groups are capable of forming hydrogen bonds like this. Where groups are not explicitly hydrogen bonded, they are probably solvated.

In this process each candidate molecule is automatically inserted, oriented and minimized into the active site.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='structure-based-design/mechanism-action-hiv-1-protease-baf11008'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The HIV-1 protease plays a crucial part in the life cycle of the HIV virus. The task of the HIV-1 protease is to cut this long 'polyprotein' into the proper protein-sized pieces. As a result of this crucial task, HIV-1 protease is an excellent target for drug therapy. Inhibitor drugs block the action of the protease and the virus perishes because it is unable to mature into its infectious form.

### Lessons From HIV-1 Protease Inhibition

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='structure-based-design/lessons-from-hiv-1-protease-inhibition-70a48ede'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The key learnings acquired in the course of this study are as follows: (1) the project took advantage of previous knowledge of other projects (renin inhibition; renin is an aspartic protease); (2) medicinal chemistry played a pivotal role in bringing data of high informational content at the beginning of the project and in enabling the design of tailor-made structures that were relatively easy to synthesize; (3) X-ray crystallography played a key role in revealing the structural features of the enzyme and the binding modes of the inhibitor. This allowed efficient design of non-peptidic structures and the rapid optimization of the lead compounds; (4) database searching provided an intermediate molecule with information of high informational content. Finally it paved the way for other projects to aim at converting the knowledge of a substrate or a peptide inhibitor into the structure of a non-peptidic drug.

## Conclusion

### Conclusion

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='structure-based-design/conclusion-b60e207f'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The molecular recognition of protein-ligand complexes is highly complex and the utilization of an iterative design process has greatly advanced the use of protein structure for the design of drug candidates. The state-of-the-art design process relies, in a large part, on a qualitative understanding of the molecular recognition of protein-ligand complexes based upon analogies to other systems and the use of several methods in parallel.
*[analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.
