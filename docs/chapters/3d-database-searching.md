!!! Info
    3D searching is a technique that is based on searching in a database of molecules for compounds that contain structural elements as defined by a 3D query. This approach can be used for a wide variety of purposes ranging from testing a pharmacophore hypothesis to the design of a library for high throughput screening. This chapter is an introduction to this field and includes the following topics: the typical uses of 3D searching, the different types of searching, the construction of 3D databases and  programs for 3D database searching.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='3d-database-searching/what-is-3d-searching-36e3bf1c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>3D searching is a technique that is based on searching in a database of molecules for compounds that contain structural elements as defined by a 3D query. Potential bioactive molecules can be recognized, based on 3D properties. For example, the view shows a superposition of the dopamine query (grey) with a rigid analogue hit (blue) that is a potent D1 dopamine agonist.
*[agonist]: A chemical substance capable of activating a given receptor.
*[analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold

#### 3D Database

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='3d-database-searching/3d-database-74dc1211'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>A 3D database is a collection of molecules organized so that it can easily be accessed, managed, and updated. A database can contain millions of compounds. In another section of this chapter we discuss the type of information that is stored in a 3D database and  how a typical 3D database is constructed.

#### Search Hypothesis

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='3d-database-searching/search-hypothesis-297a9e2a'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>A search hypothesis consists of 3D structural features that are desired to be found in molecules of the database. Composing this abstraction is often done by inspecting reference molecules in 3D. Sometimes, however, a preceding analysis will prepare the search query. The Catalyst program from Accelrys and the combination of DISCO and Unity from Tripos are examples of automatic preparation of the search query.

#### Converting a Search Hypothesis into a Query

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='3d-database-searching/converting-search-hypothesis-into-query-f06094e8'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Converting a search hypothesis into a 3D query to be understood by the program is generally easy to do. Most 3D searching programs include tools for describing the desired 3D features, qualitatively and quantitatively. A query can be an exact molecule or a fragment of a reference compound (direct query), or the result of a more subtle mental analysis (creative query).

### Test a Pharmacophore Hypothesis
*[Pharmacophore]: Specific 3D arrangement of chemical groups common to active molecules and essential to their biological activities.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='3d-database-searching/test-pharmacophore-hypothesis-d14156c5'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>3D searching is a logical method to validate a pharmacophore hypothesis. Typically a pharmacophore is expressed as distances between key points in a molecule,  and the search query can be  applied to a database to identify other  molecules having the pharmacophore considered and test them biologically, to assess the validity of the hypothesis.

### Bioactive Conformation of a Flexible Molecule
*[Bioactive Conformation]: The geometry adopted by a ligand when it binds to its biological target.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='3d-database-searching/bioactive-conformation-flexible-molecule-66f219c9'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The first step in a drug design project might be to synthesize molecules that probe the potential bioactive conformation considered. For dopamine for example, 3D searching can be used to identify rigid analogue hits corresponding to different  hypotheses (e.g. "Extended" or "Folded"). The biological testing of the hits obtained will indicate what is the conformation of dopamine when it binds to the receptor considered.
*[analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold
*[bioactive conformation]: The geometry adopted by a ligand when it binds to its biological target.

### Design a Library for HTS

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='3d-database-searching/design-library-for-hts-c60b9adc'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>One way to test a pharmacophore hypothesis is to run a high throughput screen on additional compounds identified by 3D searching to fit the hypothesis. One could also use the results of multiple 3D searches to prepare a library that examines several competing pharmacophore hypotheses. Alternatively, the library designed from 3D searching might fulfill a pharmacophore common to several related biological targets (for example kinase inhibitors). In this case the library would be used to screen new targets for this biological class.
*[pharmacophore]: Specific 3D arrangement of chemical groups common to active molecules and essential to their biological activities.

### Generate Ideas

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='3d-database-searching/generate-ideas-f3e0707a'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>3D database searching is a method of choice for generating new ideas. The hits do not need to be available in the stockroom their role is only to provide new ideas. For example, to connect fragments in a pre-determined orientation, to create original scaffolds, to replace a template by a moiety with a simple synthetic route etc... In the example below a hit prompted the idea of considering ring moieties. By itself the hit was improper but helped to conceive a novel lead structure.

## Types of 3D Searches

### Types of 3D Searches

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='3d-database-searching/types-3d-searches-89dc2897'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>As the practice of molecular modeling has matured, variations of 3D searching have been implemented.

It defines the search by the geometric relationships between points, lines, and planes identified in molecules.
*[pharmacophore]: Specific 3D arrangement of chemical groups common to active molecules and essential to their biological activities.
*[bioactive conformation]: The geometry adopted by a ligand when it binds to its biological target.

##### Constraints to Probe the Bioactive Conformation

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='3d-database-searching/constraints-to-probe-bioactive-conformation-8cfdd5b0'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Constraints can be used to probe bioactive conformations. For example, the natural product apomorphine is a D1 and D2 dopaminergic agonist that constrains the geometry of the dopamine substructure. Because it is relatively rigid (except for inversion of the nitrogen), its bioactive conformation is known and can be used to set up a 3D search for novel dopaminergics. The constraints shown here are probably more complex than needed. One may find it preferable to try several searches.

### Shape Searching

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='3d-database-searching/shape-searching-7b82d0e9'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Geometric searching can include some implicit shape constraints by specifying distances that are not allowed. On the other hand, specific geometric searching programs can take the whole shape of the binding site into consideration. Docking programs do this explicitly. However, there are also programs that do not use the 3D structure of the target macromolecule as constraints for the search.

Dozens of vendors of compounds for screening are happy to send CDs of their structures. One disadvantage of this source of compounds is that it takes time for the compounds to arrive and some will not be available. A second disadvantage is that typically anyone can purchase these compounds, hence your competitor might have already purchased samples of those that you identify.

A key feature of UNITY is that one need not store all conformations of a molecule in order to search them later. Rather, UNITY generates conformations that match the distance, angle, and shape constraints. It is able to do this quickly because when one loads a molecule into the database, 3D fingerprints are generated to encode its conformational possibilities.
