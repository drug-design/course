## Introduction

### Geometries, Energies and Conformational Analysis
*[Conformational Analysis]: The study of the geometries and their associated energies for a given molecule.

As shown in the previous chapters, a molecule possesses many conformers and an energy is associated to each of these conformations. The aim of this chapter is to present the concept of "conformational analysis" as a framework that integrates the information about geometries and energies discussed in the previous chapters.

### Energy Profile: a Global Information

The description of the energy of a molecule in the multidimensional space of its degrees of freedom defines the "conformational potential surface" of the compound. This global representation is extremely useful in understanding, assessing, controlling and eventually influencing the properties of a given molecule.

*[Conformational Analysis]: The study of the geometries and their associated energies for a given molecule.

Molecules can change their geometries by processes involving changes in torsion angles. The study of these geometries and their associated energies is called "conformational analysis".

## Potential Surface

### Conformational Potential Surface: One Rotation

In the case of a molecule with one rotatable bond, the "conformational potential surface" consists of the curve representing the molecular energy as a function of the torsion angle. The minima of the curve correspond to low energy conformations.

### Conformational Potential Surface: Two Rotations

In the case of a molecule with two rotatable bonds, the total energy is represented (Energy axis) as a function of the two variable torsion angles (Torsion 1 and Torsion 2 axis).

### Conformational Potential Surface

Most molecules have more than two variable torsion angles. Therefore their conformational potential surface cannot be visualized because the surface is defined in a space of more than 3 dimensions. This surface can be represented schematically as a curve displaying the energy as a function of a parameter (p) that has no real geometrical meaning.

### Special Forms
*[rms]: Root Mean Square: the square root of the arithmetic average of the square's set of values.

The conformational potential surface contains "local minima" (low energy conformers), "barriers" (high energy conformers), and a "global minimum" (the conformation of lowest energy). Saddle points correspond to points where not all the derivatives of the energy with respect to the coordinates are equal to zero.
*[global minimum]: The global minimum of a function is the smallest value it takes on over its entire range of possibilities

### Interconversion Between Conformers
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer

Conformational minimas are separated by transition states. The interconversion from one conformer to the other requires the crossing of the energy barrier. A low barrier corresponds to rapid interconversion rates. For example for a barrier of about 40 kJ/mol the conversion occurs one million times per second.

### Energy Barriers

When the barrier is high, the interconversion is either slow or impossible. For example for values greater than 80 kJ/mol the interconversion is not possible at room temperature.

### Interconversion Pathway

The interconversion always proceeds along the pathway of lowest energy. If there is a pathway requiring the crossing of a barrier of less than 80 kJ/mol, it will occur at room temperature.

### Systematic Scanning of All Potential Surfaces

A simple method for exploring the conformational potential surface can be accomplished by a systematic scanning of all geometries of the molecule. Each point of the surface is geometrically constructed and its energy is calculated. This provides comprehensive information about the conformational profile of the molecule.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/conformational-analysis/alt5_3_2_0_1.gif){: loading=lazy }

### Systematic Scanning is Time Consuming

However the systematic search becomes rapidly impractical. For example, the following molecule has 7 rotatable bonds and one non-planar ring. If we consider a 10&#176; resolution for each rotatable bond (36 conformers per bond) and 4 conformations for the piperazine ring, the numbers of conformers to generate is: 36x36x36x36x36x36x36x4 which correspond to 300 billion conformers. This is unfeasible and impractical.

### How to Reduce Conformational Search?

The comprehensive scanning of the surface becomes rapidly impractical; one has to find ways to reduce the number of points. In fact all the geometries inside a given well correspond to a same family of conformers. Therefore, one conformation will be sufficient for representing the entire family. At this point the conformational analysis is reduced to the identification of all the families of conformers for the molecule concerned.

The geometrical differences within a given family are in the amplitude and numerical values of the torsion angles; however from the qualitative point of view they are all the same.

### Working with a Set of Representative Conformers

With a resolution of 10&#176; the conformers of n-butane will be represented by 36 geometries. However they can be reduced to a much smaller set represented by the local minima. In this case we can select the following three equilibrium geometries: the gauche (+), gauche (-) and the anti, and not 36 positions.

#### Sildenafil Example

With such a rule, all the "typically different" conformers of the molecule are represented. In the example presented here, instead of studying hundred billions of forms, we now have only to study 8748 (3x3x3x3x3x3x3x4=8748) conformers.

In drug design applications, the minima and their relative energies are of central importance. The representative forms that are generated correspond to theoretical forms and they are not necessarily at the minimum of their corresponding well. Their energies are meaningless. In order to have meaningful values, one has to relax their geometries to find the point of minimum energy; this treatment is called "minimization".

### Conformational Analysis Principles: Summary
*[Conformational Analysis]: The study of the geometries and their associated energies for a given molecule.

In the great majority of molecules, it is not possible to systematically generate all their conformers. One has to consider a method that produces typically different conformers. They can be generated either by the analysis of their fragments or by random methods (e.g. Monte Carlo). Minimizations procedures then have to be considered for meaningful energy values.

### Improved Geometries and Good Energies

A non-minimized conformer may be used for rough geometrical analyses but not for energy considerations. A minimized structure is a good model for both the geometry and the energy.

### The Minimization Treatment
*[Minimization]: Minimization treatments consists of successive alterations of the geometry of the molecule until a minimum is found on the conformational potential surface.

In energy minimization an initial conformation is submitted to full geometry optimization, where all parameters defining the geometry of the system are modified by small increments, until the total energy of the system reaches a minimum.

### How Does Minimization Works?
*[Minimization]: Minimization treatments consists of successive alterations of the geometry of the molecule until a minimum is found on the conformational potential surface.

Small modifications of the molecular geometry are considered, if the resulting geometry has a lower energy than the original, then another step is made in the same direction. Otherwise a smaller step in a different direction is carried out. The process is continued until the energy cannot decrease.

*[Minimization]: Minimization treatments consists of successive alterations of the geometry of the molecule until a minimum is found on the conformational potential surface.

The minimization of one conformer may require thousands of iterations, each one requiring the calculation of the new energy. Moreover the minimization treatment has to be applied thousands of times (one minimization for each conformer generated).

### The Experienced Molecular Modeler
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.

A good molecular modeler can intelligently save time-consuming treatments. He can judge, assess, and estimate using the 3D manipulation of a mechanical molecular model until he feels that a calculation is needed. For example, an experienced modeler can easily guess the geometry of the global minimum of a molecule and possibly minimize 5-10 different candidate geometries instead of the thousands that would be needed in a fully computerized study. He will use the computerized treatments for clarifying features that are beyond the things he knows.

### Common Errors Made with Minimization
*[Minimization]: Minimization treatments consists of successive alterations of the geometry of the molecule until a minimum is found on the conformational potential surface.

Among the common errors that are observed in the use of molecular modeling systems is the belief that a minimized conformer has a "quality label" of validity. This is not true. The minimum obtained depends on the initial conformation that has been used. Although 'improved' by the minimization treatment, this is not sufficient. What is important is the location of this conformation with respect to the low energy minima, including the global minimum of the molecule.

*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer
*[global minimum]: The global minimum of a function is the smallest value it takes on over its entire range of possibilities

#### Example 1

This is an example of a minimized molecule corresponding to an input conformation introduced by the modeler. The problem is that the "cis" conformation of an acyclic ester is almost inexistent; the "trans" form is by far the preferred one. The population of this conformation visualized here is close to 0%. The same can also be said for amide bonds.

#### Example 2

The following is a representation of a minimized conformation of a molecule where two bulky groups are in a 1-3 diaxial orientation. The molecule will not stay in this conformation. The cyclohexane ring will change its conformation and adopt the alternative chair conformer in which the two substituents will be both in an equatorial orientation. The population of the conformation visualized here is close to 0%.

Molecular dynamics provide an alternative approach to determine the preferred conformers and the global minimum of a molecule. This is achieved by the simulation of the dynamical motions of the molecule as it vibrates and undergoes internal rotation.

### Theoretical Basis of Molecular Dynamic Calculations

Molecular dynamics is an extension of the molecular mechanics approach and based on the idea that the atoms of the molecule feel forces and want to move. Each atom is treated as a particle responding to Newton's equations of motion. Integration of these equations with successive time steps lead to the trajectory of the atoms over time in the form of a list of positions and velocities.

### Local Minima and Global Minimum
*[Global Minimum]: The global minimum of a function is the smallest value it takes on over its entire range of possibilities

Molecular dynamic simulations can be used to obtain low energy conformers. The simulations can run with differing temperatures to obtain different families of conformers. At higher temperatures, more conformers are possible and it becomes feasible to cross energy barriers. Current methodology and computer capabilities do not allow the sampling of the conformational space of large molecules.

### Simulated Annealing, a Special Type of Dynamics

Simulated annealing is a technique where the molecule is heated and then cooled very slowly so that conformational changes occurring will be at a local minimum. This process is generally repeated many times until several very closely related and low energy conformations are obtained. The conformer of lowest energy is assumed to be global minimum.

### Coherency of Molecular Motions

The motions of the atoms and chemical groups obtained by molecular dynamics simulation reveal subtle underlying molecular machinery. In the beginning of the simulation, the motions are frequently interrupted by collisions with neighboring groups and each group seems to have an erratic trajectory. However, over longer periods of time, coherent and collective motions start to develop, revealing how some groups can fluctuate somewhat more than others.

### A Typical Molecular Dynamics Run

Typically one can generate about 100 conformations and minimize them with molecular mechanics. The minimized forms are used as starting points for dynamics simulation varying the time and temperature. For each starting point, a number of steps of dynamics at 1 femtosecond intervals are made; the coordinates and energy of each point are recorded. The conformation representing every picosecond steps is saved, and finally, at the end of the study, the atoms' trajectories can be displayed as a movie by quickly displaying the sequence of individual frames. Throughout the treatments, conformers with low energies are saved (coordinates and energies).
