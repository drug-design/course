## Introduction

### Internal Energy of a Molecule

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-energies/internal-energy-molecule-aaaacd0c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>All chemical systems contain a certain amount of internal energy consisting of potential and kinetic energies. The potential energy is directly related to chemical bonding and non-bonding interactions whereas the kinetic energy is related to random molecular motions. Each geometry (conformation) of a molecule has its specific internal energy; this is due to different non-bonding interactions.

### Internal Energy Associated to a Conformation

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-energies/internal-energy-associated-to-conformation-a93a5ee8'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Every conformation of a molecule has an internal energy. This energy is represented by a number (in kcal/mol or in kJ/mol), which indicates if the conformation is of low, medium or high energy.

### Transition State

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-energies/transition-state-794e5858'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The conversion of a conformer of a molecule into another one involves a high energy geometry, also known as the transition state. This high energy operates as a barrier that the molecule has to cross in order to change its three dimensional structure.

### Thermodynamics &#38; Kinetics

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-energies/thermodynamics-amp-kinetics-5203595c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Kinetics and thermodynamics are two important concepts, which are involved in all dynamic systems. For molecules, thermodynamics define the ratio at equilibrium between molecular conformers (which conformers are possible) while kinetics define the speed (rate) of exchange from one conformation to another. These two concepts are often confused and the next pages will give some practical examples to illustrate and clarify them.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-energies/thermodynamics-conformer-populations-7cb79b84'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The lower the energy of a conformation of a given molecule, the more likely it is to be populated. Consider the general situation of a molecule in equilibrium in two conformational states. The population of each conformer is directly related to the difference of energy between them (E2-E1).

## Kinetics

### Kinetics

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-energies/kinetics-885095d9'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The answer to the question "how and how fast do conformers interconvert?" requires knowledge of the system kinetics, specifically the energy barrier between the different forms. This energy barrier is related to the geometrical (steric) and electronic changes occurring in the conformational changes and its height is a function of those changes.

*[Molecular Modeling]: A field that models molecular behavior with theoretical methods and computational techniques.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-energies/molecular-modeling-drug-design-d1a54bd1'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Let's assume we know the bioactive conformation of a specific biomolecule.             
            One of the main goals in the design of a new drug is to conceive a structure for which the conformation that mimics the bioactive form of the reference compound is of low energy and therefore this increases the chance of having an active compound.
*[bioactive conformation]: The geometry adopted by a ligand when it binds to its biological target.

### Morphinan and D-nor Morphinan Alignment

Are the small differences we see in the view sufficient for accounting the large differences we observe in the biological activities? To answer that question, additional analyses are necessary to better assess and understand the exact stereochemical requirements for binding to the receptor.

### A Rationale for Explaining the Activities Observed

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-energies/rationale-for-explaining-activities-observed-7e28348d'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The orientation of the nitrogen lone pair is the key to interpret the biological activities observed. A good recognition by the receptor may require this lone pair to be oriented away from the benzene ring. D-nor morphinan would be active if the conformer with the lone-pair oriented away from the aromatic ring would be populated enough, but with such an energy difference (7.53 kJ/mol) it is not sufficiently populated (4.3%).

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-energies/morphinan-validation-design-60cd92d8'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In order to validate the hypothesis that the lone pair of the nitrogen atom must be oriented away from the phenolic fragment, the 16,17 butanomorphinan was prepared and the two enantiomeric molecules were separated. In one of them the lone pair was in the "proper" orientation, whereas in the second one the lone pair was oriented in the opposite direction. The molecule with the lone pair oriented away from the benzene ring proved to be active; the second enantiomer was inactive. Information on the conformations of the two enantiomers is given in the next pages.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-energies/preferred-conformer-active-enantiomer-481b4ac6'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The active enantiomer of 16,17 butanomorphinan has a stereochemistry with H16 down. This compound can exist in two alternative all-chair conformations with the D/E fusion being either cis or trans (lone pair either gauche or anti, relative to the angular hydrogen H16). Force field minimizations indicate that the trans system is more stable than the cis, and this corresponds to a geometry where the lone pair is oriented away from the aromatic A-ring.

The first is in an all chair conformation and a cis D/E fusion (lone pair and H16 gauche); however it has a high energy because of steric clashes with the axial hydrogen atoms of ring E. The second one has a trans D/E fusion (lone pair and H16 anti) with however a boat geometry for ring D. Despite the unfavorable energy of the boat, this conformer is preferred due to the relief of the steric interactions with the axial hydrogen atoms. Force field minimizations show that there is a difference of 9.6 kJ/mol in favor of the boat conformer, which corresponds to a lone pair oriented towards the aromatic A-ring.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-energies/ab-initio-semi-empirical-calculations-d4afe7e2'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The Schrodinger equation can be solved either with no approximations at all (ab-initio) or with the introduction of some approximations (semiempirical). An exact solution is today an impossible mathematical problem for small molecular systems; however, acceptable approximate solutions may be obtained with semiempirical methods for calculating the conformations of molecules with several hundreds of electrons. One way to approximate is to treat only the valence electrons (and not all of them as in ab initio methods) for the construction of atomic orbitals.

### Calculation of Energies

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-energies/calculation-energies-5985d62f'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Energies of a specific geometry are calculated with "self consistent field" methods (SCF) where the approximate initial wave function is iteratively modified until the total energy does not decrease. Full geometry optimization therefore requires two types of minimization: one for the calculation of the energies (SCF calculations) and one for the optimization of the geometries.

They are useful only when comparing the values obtained for different geometries of the same system. Not only should one not compare the numbers obtained for the energies from one program to another, but for a given program, the energy calculated for a molecule must not be compared to the energy calculated for another molecule (except in closely related systems, such as isomers).
