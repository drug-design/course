## Conjugated Systems

### Butadiene

When two double bonds are separated by a single bond (conjugated system), they tend to be coplanar, a geometry that maximizes the overlap of the &pi; orbitals of the system. The coplanarity is achieved in the s-cis and the s-trans conformations of the conjugated fragment. The s-trans conformer is preferred by 11.5 kJ/mol.

### Pentenone

However, in Z-pent-3-ene-2-one the s-cis conformer is preferred (by about 10 kJ/mol) because of the steric repulsion occurring between the two methyl groups when the molecule is in the s-trans conformation.

### Dipyrrole

When two aromatic rings are connected by a single bond, the molecule adopts a planar conformation as long as there are no severe steric repulsions. Dipyrrole is a planar molecule.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/conformational-analysis-examples/snap_v1_b6_2_3.png){: loading=lazy }

### Biphenyl

Biphenyl cannot be planar, due to steric repulsions between the ortho hydrogens on the aromatic rings. A rotation of about 35&#176; occurs around the single bond where a compromise is found between the steric and the optimal conjugative effects. In this conformation the molecule is partially deconjugated.

### Atropisomerism of Biphenyls
*[isomer]: Isomers are compounds with the same chemical formula but different 2D-structures

Most tetra ortho substituted biphenyls are optically resolvable. This is due to the restricted rotation about the single bond. This phenomena is called "atropisomerism", the rotational barrier is high enough to permit isolation of the two isomers. An example of enantiomeric chiral biphenyls is visualized here.

### Binaphthyl

The steric repulsions in binaphthyl are so severe that the molecule adopts a conformation with a torsion angle of 66&#176;. There is no conjugation left and the aromatic rings are almost orthogonal.

### Distorted Naphthalene

When bulky substituents are introduced in the &alpha; positions, they alter the planarity (therefore the conjugation) of the molecule. The following view illustrates the distorded geometry adopted by 1,8-di-t-butylnaphthalene, the angle between the two substituents is about 68&#176;.

### Fusing Another Ring 

By fusing another ring one gets a fused ring system with steric repulsions. These repulsions are relieved by a small alteration of the planarity of the polyaromatic system.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/conformational-analysis-examples/snap_v1_b6_3_3_s2.gif){: loading=lazy }

### Fusing Again Another Ring 

The molecule obtained with the fusion with another ring has more severe steric repulsions, which increases the deviation from the planarity of this five ringed fused system.

### Continue to Fuse Additional Rings

The effect is amplified by fusing additional rings. Such polyaromatic annelated systems adopt a helical geometry in which the steric repulsions are reduced to the minimum. This structure is aromatic, non-planar and chiral; the (-) helix is visualized here.

## Cyclic Systems

### Why Substituents Prefer to be Equatorial?

Due to the existence of two possible chair conformations of the ring, the substituent of mono-substituted cyclohexanes can be either in the equatorial or in the axial orientation. However because of the 1,3 diaxial repulsions in the axial conformer the equatorial conformer is preferred.

### Mono-Substituted Cyclohexanes

The equatorial conformer is preferred because of the strong van der Waals repulsions that exist in the axial conformer. The greater the size of the substituent, the higher the difference of energy between the two forms.

### Example of Preferred Axial Conformer

Axial substituents introduce strain energies because of the 1,3 diaxial repulsions. However, if for some reason there are no interactions of this type, the axial conformer becomes more populated. This is the case of the molecule represented here. The preferred conformer has the tert-butyl group in the axial orientation and the difference of energy between the equatorial and the axial conformers is 6 kJ/mol.

### Chloro-2 Cyclohexanone

The difference of energy between the two conformers of chloro-2 cyclohexanone is 2.7 kJ/mol in favor of the axial conformer. This can be understood by the repulsion between the two dipoles C=O and C-Cl that are nearly parallel in the equatorial form. In non-polar solvents such as heptane, the axial conformer is dominant; however in polar solvents such as methanol, the equatorial conformation becomes preferred due to solvent dispersal (or moderating) of the dipole interactions.

### Decalins

Cis and trans decalins are molecules containing two cyclohexane rings fused together. The two rings can be fused in a cis or in a trans manner depending on the orientations of the angular hydrogens. In the cis decalin the two hydrogens are cis, and in the trans decalin they are trans.

#### Cis-decalin

Cis-decalin has two non-identical interconverting chair-chair conformations. Each conformer is the mirror image of the other and the two forms are equally populated. Cis-decalin can also interconvert into chair-boat and boat-boat conformations, however they are of higher energies.

##### Methyl-Cis-decalin

The interconverting chair-chair conformations of cis-decalin changes an equatorial substituent into an axial orientation, and vice-versa. As a consequence substituted cis decalins prefer the substituent(s) in the equatorial orientation. For example, the preferred conformer of a methyl cis decalin is the one with the methyl group equatorial.

#### Interactions Revealed by X-Ray Crystallography

A crystallographic structure of a protein reveals a great deal of information about the interactions between aromatic moieties. The following view illustrates the complex of a protein with a cofactor and an inhibitor; a stacking interaction is observed and highlighted here.
*[inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[moieties]: Fragments, functional groups or portions of chemical compounds.
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer

#### Two Major Types of Aromatic Interactions

Two types of aromatic interactions are highlighted here, the one involving a stacking and the other an orthogonal interaction.

#### Overview of Possible Interactions

Here are the interactions we mentioned in example 2; for clarity the rest of the structure was removed.

### Geometry of Ester Groups

The ester moiety is planar. In principle it can exist in two geometries, the cis-(E) and the trans-(Z). However the E isomer is never observed in acyclic ester systems, the difference of energy between the E and the Z forms is so large that it is difficult to measure. Theoretical calculations indicate a difference of 25 kJ/mol in favor of the Z isomer.

*[moiety]: Fragments, functional groups or portions of chemical compounds.
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer
*[isomer]: Isomers are compounds with the same chemical formula but different 2D-structures
*[rms]: Root Mean Square: the square root of the arithmetic average of the square's set of values.

#### Cyclic Ester

An ester moiety is in the cis (E) conformation when it is part of a cyclic system (lactone structures). In this case the geometrical constraints of the ring force the ester group to adopt this geometry.

### Geometry of Amide Groups

The amide moiety is planar. It can exist in the cis (E) or in the trans (Z) geometries, however there is a difference of energy of 10 kJ/mol in favor of the Z isomer. This means that the population of the E isomer is less than 3% at room temperature. Acyclic amide systems are therefore found in the Z geometry, in particular in protein structures.

If the nitrogen atom does not carry a hydrogen atom, then the two geometries E and Z become possible.

#### Cyclic Amide

An amide moiety is in the cis (E) conformation when it is part of a cyclic system (lactam structures). In this case the geometrical constraints of the ring, force the amide group to adopt this geometry.
