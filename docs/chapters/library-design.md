## Introduction

### Libraries of Molecules Prepared One by One

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/libraries-molecules-prepared-one-by-one-ebdfe4ae'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In the past a "library" consisted of a collection of molecules prepared one by one. The library contained molecules more for purposes of archiving, subsequent patent protection and  multiple-project screening than for developing a comprehensive strategy designed to accelerate the discovery process for a project.

### The Combinatorial Chemistry Boom

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/combinatorial-chemistry-boom-a1fdb32c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The combinatorial chemistry boom that emerged in the nineties enabled tens of thousands of compounds to be made in a single cycle, whereas only 50-70 compounds could be synthesized each year by a medicinal chemist using traditional methods. This breakthrough fueled  new expectations based on the feeling that the increase in the number of molecules synthesized would lead to more chances to find a hit in the biological tests.

### The Quest of Quality

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/quest-quality-89d89a27'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Early in the 2000's it became apparent that CombiChem and rapid high throughput synthesis capabilities were not just a game of numbers, but rather a matter of thorough design with an intelligent choice of compounds to be synthesized.

### Chemical Diversity Space

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/chemical-diversity-space-6dffcd79'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>It has been estimated that the total number of small organic molecules is about 10<sup>200</sup>, and this defines the entire space of all possible candidate molecules. With CombiChem technologies the medicinal chemist can design and synthesize many of them; however he must address important critical choices which are  restricted  by a number of factors including the scaffold limitations, reagents availability, synthetic feasibility, time frame, cost ceilings, laboratory capabilities  etc...

### Library Representation

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/library-representation-1d50c3f6'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Most combinatorial chemical libraries can be represented as a fixed scaffold and a set of variable R-groups (commonly between 1 and 4). Each of these variable positions is filled by a set of fragments known as a substituent. In the table you can click either the headers (R<sub>i</sub>) or the substituents.

### Definition of a Virtual Library
*[Virtual Library]: A library which exists solely in electronic form (or on paper) and used in the design and evaluation of possible real libraries.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/definition-virtual-library-279c1f00'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The expression "virtual library" refers to the assembly of all the molecules that could potentially be made with a given scaffold using all possible reactants. For example, the following scaffold can generate one million products, the number of reagents available for R1, R2 and R3 being 200, 50 and 100, respectively. The number of products that can be generated far exceeds practical limits to be of use.

### Scaffolds-Substituents-Reactions

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/scaffolds-substituents-reactions-3d4ea478'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>An efficient library design program resides in the right combination of the following three features: scaffolds, substituents and reactions. In the following sections we discuss each of these issues in some detail.

## The Basis of a Good Scaffold

### Scaffold: the First Piece of a Complex Jigsaw Puzzle

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/scaffold-first-piece-complex-jigsaw-puzzle-aae58c49'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The choice of the scaffold is the first major decision the medicinal chemist needs to make.  It is the first element of a complex jigsaw puzzle that will lead the combinatorial chemistry effort towards success or to a dead end. The choice not only limits considerably the molecular space explored, but also predetermines many facets of the future lead.

### Cyclic and Acyclic Scaffold

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/cyclic-acyclic-scaffold-208a447c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Most drugs are made of heterocycles and it is not surprising that they are very often the first choice in library design. Nevertheless acyclic scaffolds are also important in drug discovery: the term "scaffold" should therefore be taken in a broad sense, i.e. including acyclic moeties.

### The Scaffold, a Fuzzy Concept
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/scaffold-fuzzy-concept-03fba49e'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>A scaffold generally results from a reasoning comprising some fuzziness. Suppose for example that we want to develop a combinatorial chemistry program based on the structure of the hit shown below. What scaffold should be extracted? a simple imidazole moiety? a benzimidazole heterocycle? or should we include one or two of the substituents that were present in the initial hit?
*[moiety]: Fragments, functional groups or portions of chemical compounds.

### The Scaffold Names

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/scaffold-names-f170a531'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>There are many designations for a scaffold. The most commonly used names are scaffold, template, structural fragment, core, building block, nucleus, moiety, skeleton etc...
*[moiety]: Fragments, functional groups or portions of chemical compounds.

### Scaffold Requirements

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/scaffold-requirements-906dc9f5'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The choice of a scaffold is based on thorough analyses assessing its capabilities with respect to multiple requirements. The ideal scaffold is expected to carry all the properties described below. In the following pages we discuss each of the different items appearing in this list.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/library-design/template_patent.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Scaffold and ADME Properties
*[ADME]: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/scaffold-adme-properties-336463c8'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In the next sections we will show that the ADME-Tox properties of a lead are  determined to a great extent by the properties of the scaffold. Once the scaffold is fixed, the modulation of these properties becomes restricted. It may be a challenge to substantially change the permeability or the solubility, for example. It is important for the physicochemical properties of the scaffold to carry favorable structural features so that compounds contained within the library constitute good starting points for further optimization.

#### Geometrical Requirements

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/geometrical-requirements-52b313bb'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The geometrical, and sometimes also the conformational features of the scaffold, are of paramount importance. The scaffold must (1) not be exposed to risks of clashes with the binding sites; (2) present robust binding interactions and finally (3) it must present good directions for the substituents.

##### Avoid Clashes with the Receptor

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/avoid-clashes-receptor-fac27b99'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The scaffold must not be exposed to the risk of clashes with the receptor, and this is the first requirement. Bumps with the receptor  theoretically appear only with the substituents, not with the scaffold. The HIV-1 protease and Renin are both aspartic proteases with a similar catalytic site; in Renin however, the space available is much smaller.  The cyclic urea is suited for HIV-1, whereas for Renin, only an acyclic scaffold can be envisaged.

##### Good Binding Interactions With the Scaffold

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/good-binding-interactions-scaffold-bc12391f'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The second requirement for a scaffold is to contribute to binding. For example many scaffolds of kinase inhibitors present good anchorage capabilities with the formation of two hydrogen bonds, in a bidentate manner as illustrated below. These interactions are crucial for biological activities.
*[inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[inhibitors]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[bidentate]: Having two anchorage points

##### Good Vector Orientation

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/good-vector-orientation-aec977ee'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The third role of a scaffold is to hold the essential elements of the pharmacophore in the proper 3D geometrical orientation. In the following example the seven-membered ring scaffold carries the substituents in a good orientation that allows for favorable interactions with the receptor.
*[pharmacophore]: Specific 3D arrangement of chemical groups common to active molecules and essential to their biological activities.

#### Patent Position and Novelty

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/patent-position-novelty-883333f5'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>R&#38;D costs for a pharmaceutical company can reach $800 million to get a new chemical entity to the market, and effective protection of the molecules is therefore of the outmost importance. The scaffold is at the center of the intellectual property business and the chemical structures in the claim are examined for their novelty and patentability.

##### Problems of Scaffolds Patentability

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/problems-scaffolds-patentability-2dc7955b'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The patentability of a scaffold is a difficult problem  to solve. Very often the medicinal chemist is more or less submitted to the attraction of  the "me-too-ism" or of the existence of a "hole" in a patent. Therefore some types of scaffolds repeatedly appear in a great number of patents.

##### Patentable Scaffold

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/patentable-scaffold-bcb57834'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Bioisosteric transformation has been widely used to circumvent a particular patentability problem. This is illustrated below in the case of the sildenafil drug (viagra).
*[Bioisosteric]: A compound resulting from the exchange of a group of atoms with another and having similar biological properties to the parent compound.

##### Validation of Novelty

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/validation-novelty-2670cfa4'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Before embarking upon a costly development operation, it is important to make sure that the compounds can be effectively patented.  The following illustrates some steps that can be taken to verify the patentability of a given scaffold. If the scaffold is not described in the literature (perhaps due to synthetic difficulties), this is a good opportunity for the company to reexamine its feasibility in the light of recent in-house technological advances.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/syntheses-amenable-to-combinatorial-chemistry-62e60dce'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The combinatorial synthesis approach of libraries of organic compounds for high throughput screening requires the availability of scaffolds amenable to combinatorial chemistry reactions, that also can be automated. This requires medicinal chemistry expertise and computational tools.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/bond-formation-for-array-synthesis-methods-f56af1fd'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In combinatorial chemistry the major challenge has been making carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond-forming reactions amenable to the methods of array synthesis. For example, ring closure metathesis, olefination and arylation of aromatic rings constitute some reaction classes suitable for combinatorial synthesis. Both solid phase and solution phase synthetic methods can be envisaged.

### Ideal Scaffold: a Multi-Project Template

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/ideal-scaffold-multi-project-template-0f73d15e'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>It is essential for a pharmaceutical company to reduce its R&#38;D cost. One solution is to own one or two scaffolds that have the potential to interact with a large number of biological targets. These "master-scaffolds" allow the company to consider its R&#38;D in a multi-project perspective. In a given sub-project, appropriate substituents can be introduced in the reference master-scaffold to generate a drug candidate that will achieve potency and selectivity for the disease under consideration.

#### A Universal Spacer as a Master Key

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/universal-spacer-as-master-key-819d5c29'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>A universal spacer is a core scaffold having structural characteristics that are  compatible with the structures of a great number of biological targets. Starting with the initial proprietary master-scaffold, refined analogs are designed that exploit the particular 3D arrangement of the active site to achieve good binding interactions.
*[analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold
*[analogs]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold

##### Diversity of the Space Covered by the Substituents

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/diversity-space-covered-by-substituents-d14cec67'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>An important requirement for a scaffold to become a "master key" is to carry a good geometrical diversity in the virtual space of its substituents. This provides versatility and flexibility to the medicinal chemist, who decides where to introduce substituents that will adapt to the 3D requirements of many biological targets. The benzodiazepine structure, a sugar moiety or an indole scaffold (see below) are examples of templates with such diversity.
*[moiety]: Fragments, functional groups or portions of chemical compounds.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/master-key-adapted-for-family-40aa0df9'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Another possibility of exploiting  a scaffold in a multi-project approach consists of addressing a particular family of target proteins, where small modifications of the structure of a ligand can change the action of the molecule under consideration. A design technology can be produced that exploits the similarities and small differences of the 3D architectures of the proteins concerned, and enables the design of lead candidates for each of them, where potency and specificity are achieved in a rational way (possibly leading to drug candidates for different indication areas).

## Scaffold Selection and Design

### Methods for Designing a new Scaffold

### Small Modification of Known Scaffold

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/small-modification-known-scaffold-2c7d6f97'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The most commonly used method for designing a new scaffold consists of modifying the structure of a known active compound. Many such examples are described in the chapter "Structure-Activity Relationships". In the illustration below, the structure of the imidazole derivative SB 203580 (p38 kinase inhibitor) was exploited to define another series with a pyrrole scaffold, such as L-167307.

This can be automated and incorporated in virtual screening treatments.

By screening such readily available focused libraries, it is possible to extract predictive structure-activity hypotheses with which to continue to create novel chemically unrelated and proprietary series.

An example of implementation is illustrated here. The process starts by selecting a compound at random and identifying the molecule in the database that is most dissimilar. That molecule is then added to the subset of the initial compound and the process is repeated until the subset is of the desired size.

The clustering process is computationally expensive, whereas the subsequent molecule selection is very trivial. Diversity is achieved by selecting a compound from each cluster.

Note that molecules which only satisfy 3 rules are not always eliminated (this depends on the problem to be solved).

#### Other Rules

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/other-rules-63372afc'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Following the idea initiated by Lipinski, other rules were developed and are currently used in the primary filtering of molecules for high through-put screening. These rules are not always related to ADME properties some of them were introduced to get rid of molecules which were difficult to optimize (e.g. many chiral centers etc...). The common characteristics of all these rules is that they can be calculated quickly and allow for the real time filtering of millions of compounds.

Retrospective analyses show that 70% of the drug-like molecules have between 2 and 8 rotatable bonds. There is a general consensus that overly flexible  molecules must be rejected (e.g. with more than 12 rotatable bonds). The following diagram illustrates the profile of the molecules of a library in terms of the rotatable bond distribution.

The filtering process will therefore eliminate molecules with more than 4 rings. Sometimes the size of the rings are also considered: molecules with rings higher than seven-membered are eliminated.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/remove-false-positive-hits-db0b0807'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Some molecules emerge repeatedly as hits in diverse unrelated target systems. These so-called "promiscuous" hits act non-competitively, show little structure-activity relationships, and have poor selectivity: they artificially inflate hit rate in screening. Their mechanism of action remains unknown (in some cases aggregates are formed that are the inhibitory species). These types of non-specific molecules should be recognized and removed from any biological assays!

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='library-design/final-results-dcec2feb'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In the example presented here, we discussed the successive steps for the comparative analysis of two libraries A and B. We illustrated the use of structural keys for assessing their diversity (with molecular descriptors or structural keys). Then, we showed how to reduce the complexity (dimensionality) of the analyses by using PCA methodologies. Finally, from the initial set of compounds initially gathered, we were able to reject 50% of them, and identify unique compounds with suitable properties which deserve to be included in the corporate collection of compounds, and represent a valuable library for virtual screening applications.
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer
*[molecular descriptor]: Molecular descriptors are numerical values that capture the structure and properties of molecules
*[molecular descriptors]: Molecular descriptors are numerical values that capture the structure and properties of molecules
