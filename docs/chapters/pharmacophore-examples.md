!!! Info
    The present chapter presents how pharmacophores can be derived from a set of known active and inactive compounds. For each example the entire process is described in detail. In some cases the successful exploitation of the pharmacophore is illustrated with designed molecules conforming to the requirements of the pharmacophore.

## ACE Inhibitors
*[Inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[Inhibitors]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.

### Therapeutic Utility of ACE Inhibitors
*[Inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[Inhibitors]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in the control of blood pressure through various effects of angiotensin II, which is a potent pressor peptide. ACE inhibitors have the potential to specifically block the formation of angiotensin II and thus reduce high blood pressure.
*[inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[inhibitors]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.

### The ACE Enzyme

ACE is a carboxypeptidase enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of two amino acids from the C-terminal of the Angiotensin I substrate, generating the octapeptide Angiotensin II. Its active site contains a Zinc atom. ACE inhibitors are useful antihypertensive agents.
*[inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[inhibitors]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.

### Discovery of the First ACE Inhibitor
*[Inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.

Captopril is the first ACE-inhibitor that was discovered. The validity of the therapeutic concept has been proven by the successful commercialization of this compound whose creation opened an entirely new class of orally active antihypertensive agents.
*[inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer

Psychosis is a thought disorder characterized by disturbances of reality and perception. It is well established that all clinically effective antipsychotic agents act by modulating central dopaminergic activity. This action is interpreted by the ability of these substances to act as antagonists at dopamine receptors in the CNS (central nervous system). At least five distinct dopamine receptors (D1 to D5) have been characterized; however it appears that the specific interaction of antipsychotic drugs with the D2 receptor is most important to their therapeutic action.

## Beta-Lactam Antibiotics

### Biological Action of Beta-Lactam Antibiotics

The biological action of penicillins and cephalosporins is based on the ability of the antibiotic to irreversibly acylate the active site of the transpeptidase enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall. The bacteria is killed because the inhibition of cross-linking leads to the appearance of imperfections in its protecting 3-D wall, which eventually explodes under osmotic pressure.

### Does Penicillin Mimic an Endogenous Peptide?

The enzyme involved in the biosynthesis recognizes D-Ala-D-Ala terminal residues in order to carry out the cross-linking for the construction of the bacterial cell wall. This step is inhibited by the antibiotic. One can understand the antibiotic action as the drug's ability to mimic the same stereochemical features of the endogenous D-Ala-D-Ala terminal residues.

### Attempts to Increase Antibacterial Activities

Based on these considerations, it was suggested that the mimicry could be improved by introducing an additional methyl group in the penicillins to mimic the methyl residue of D-Ala-D-Ala. This was expected to reveal molecules with enhanced antibiotic activities. The methyl analogues were synthesized both in the penicillin and cephalosporin series.

### Methyl Penicillins and Methyl Cephalosporins

Incoporating this idea, 6a-methyl-penicillins and 7a-methyl-cephalosporins were synthesized but were practically inactive.

### A Good Hypothesis with a Bad Design!

The methyl analogs showed poor biological activities. The design was in fact based only on 2D considerations. Looking at the structures in 3D reveals some subtle aspects that might be important. In particular, one can see that the methyl groups in the antibiotics and in D-Ala-D-Ala do not have the same orientation. This might be the reason for the weak activities observed for the methylated analogs.

### An Example of a Good Hypothesis Well Exploited

Increasing the mimicry with D-ala-D-ala was perhaps a good idea however it was not properly exploited. Looking now at the structures in 3D indicates that a methoxy substituent (instead of a methyl) would lead to better mimics with the endogenous substrate. Indeed the methoxy analogs were synthesized both in the penicillin and cephalosporin series and showed enhanced biological activities when compared to the unsubstituted analogs.

## GABA-Uptake Inhibitors
*[Inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[Inhibitors]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.

### Therapeutic Utility of GABA-Uptake Inhibitors
*[Inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[Inhibitors]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.

GABA (&gamma;-aminobutyric acid) is a major neurotransmitter. The dysfunction of GABA-ergic synapses has been invoked in Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and schizophrenia. One of the possible ways to palliate the GABA deficiency lies in the inhibition of uptake mechanisms of this neurotransmitter.

Several GABA-uptake inhibitors were discovered; SKF 89976-A and SKF 100330-A represent examples of such inhibitors. The analyses of their 3D structures permitted the definition of a pharmacophore model for GABA-uptake inhibition.

The pharmacophore derived for GABA-uptake inhibitors is the following: the amine function should be located at a distance of 4.2 &#8491; from the center of the acidic group. The first phenyl ring is located 9.5 &#8491; from the acidic center and 6 &#8491; from the amino group while the second phenyl ring is at a distance of 10.5 &#8491; from the acidic center and 6.5 &#8491; from the amine.
