# Examples of Pharmacophores
!!! Authors

!!! Info
    The present chapter presents how pharmacophores can be derived from a set of known active and inactive compounds. For each example the entire process is described in detail. In some cases the successful exploitation of the pharmacophore is illustrated with designed molecules conforming to the requirements of the pharmacophore.

ACE inhibitors have the potential to specifically block the formation of angiotensin II and thus reduce high blood pressure.

### The ACE Enzyme

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-examples/ace-enzyme-038d2728'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>ACE is a carboxypeptidase enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of two amino acids from the C-terminal of the Angiotensin I substrate, generating the octapeptide Angiotensin II. Its active site contains a Zinc atom. ACE inhibitors are useful antihypertensive agents.
*[inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.

It is well established that all clinically effective antipsychotic agents act by modulating central dopaminergic activity. This action is interpreted by the ability of these substances to act as antagonists at dopamine receptors in the CNS (central nervous system). At least five distinct dopamine receptors (D1 to D5) have been characterized; however it appears that the specific interaction of antipsychotic drugs with the D2 receptor is most important to their therapeutic action.

### Biological Action of Beta-Lactam Antibiotics

The bacteria is killed because the inhibition of cross-linking leads to the appearance of imperfections in its protecting 3-D wall, which eventually explodes under osmotic pressure.

### Does Penicillin Mimic an Endogenous Peptide?

This step is inhibited by the antibiotic. One can understand the antibiotic action as the drug's ability to mimic the same stereochemical features of the endogenous D-Ala-D-Ala terminal residues.

This was expected to reveal molecules with enhanced antibiotic activities. The methyl analogues were synthesized both in the penicillin and cephalosporin series.

### A Good Hypothesis with a Bad Design!

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-examples/good-hypothesis-bad-design-ac29dd1f'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The methyl analogs showed poor biological activities. The design was in fact based only on 2D considerations. Looking at the structures in 3D reveals some subtle aspects that might be important. In particular, one can see that the methyl groups in the antibiotics and in D-Ala-D-Ala do not have the same orientation. This might be the reason for the weak activities observed for the methylated analogs.

### An Example of a Good Hypothesis Well Exploited

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-examples/an-example-good-hypothesis-well-exploited-54ab7eb2'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Increasing the mimicry with D-ala-D-ala was perhaps a good idea however it was not properly exploited. Looking now at the structures in 3D indicates that a methoxy substituent (instead of a methyl) would lead to better mimics with the endogenous substrate. Indeed the methoxy analogs were synthesized both in the penicillin and cephalosporin series and showed enhanced biological activities when compared to the unsubstituted analogs.
