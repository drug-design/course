The central question is which elements should be mimicked in order to obtain biologically active molecules? Should all the elements be mimicked or only a part of the reference compound?

### Analogy with Keys
*[Analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/analogy-keys-cc3f0ecd'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Similar to a key that activates a mechanical lock, some of the elements of a biologically active molecule are essential while others are not. One of the roles of the non-essential elements is to hold the essential elements in the proper 3D geometrical orientation.

### Active Molecules are Complicated Keys

In an active molecule, this may not be the case. The "handle" can have essential elements while the "teeth" may have elements that are not essential in activating the "lock". The following example shows a molecule with a "handle" containing two essential functional groups (carbonyl and N-H) as well as an element of the "teeth" (phenyl group) that is not essential. The pharmacophore is defined by all the structural elements that are essential for the specified biological activity.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/analysis-stage-68e095f4'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Now that the raw data has been collected, one must produce additional data that can be deduced from the existing information. The proper development of in depth analyses generates new knowledge, hypotheses and the establishment of a logical link between the different components of the information. The aim of the analysis is to create a framework that integrates the knowledge deduced from the structural elements that are essential for the biological activities and from the stereochemical features of the receptor site.

### Superimpositions

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/superimpositions-a2293eb9'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The easiest way to identify common 3D features in a series of molecules is to "superimpose" them. When chemically unrelated compounds are compared, superimposition techniques are extremely useful. Note that the word "superimposition" can be used interchangeably with the word "alignment". They both refer to the same technique.

We wanted to find the common structural features shared by the molecules and used superimposition techniques to reveal them. This paved the way for additional insights by analyzing both molecules in terms of their essential and non-essential structural moieties, the exact relative location of the structural elements that carry the biological activities, and their intrinsic physico-chemical properties.

### Dummy Atoms

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/dummy-atoms-acc9720b'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>It is sometimes very helpful to use "dummy atoms" associated to a molecule as points to be used for the superimpositions. For example a dummy atom located at the center of a phenyl ring can be used to define all the atoms of the ring; such dummy atoms are also called "centroids".

## Complexity Levels

### Rigid and Flexible Molecules

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/rigid-flexible-molecules-b8895b28'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>A molecule with only several rotatable bonds can have thousands of possible conformations.

## Principles of Analysis

### Complexity of Analyses (1/3)

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/complexity-analyses-13-8c2e83f8'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>When superimpositions are obtained, the molecular modeler acquires a vast amount of data due to the conformational complexity of the molecules. However, his analyses are far from being complete. To methodically pursue them, he should assess the validity of the superimpositions, review their consistency with all the available data, define pharmacophores, consider different working hypotheses,?
*[pharmacophore]: Specific 3D arrangement of chemical groups common to active molecules and essential to their biological activities.
*[pharmacophores]: Specific 3D arrangement of chemical groups common to active molecules and essential to their biological activities.

#### Complexity of Analyses (2/3)

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/complexity-analyses-23-25cb6118'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>... challenge them by making a note of all data that favor or contradict a given hypothesis, define molecules that offer the possibility of refining a given hypothesis, assign weight to data that supports the hypotheses, and finally undertake computerized treatments for generating novel information.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/complexity-analyses-33-5934b113'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Using common sense and intuition, they must combine all the knowledge acquired in the course of the analyses to decide which is the preferred model. Only when analysis has fully utilized all the content of the data, can the design phase and its associated operational strategies begin.

### Six Rules for Analyses

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/six-rules-for-analyses-0d8425d0'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In order to better understand the logical developments that might take place in the course of the analyses, let us come back to the analogy with keys and distinguish six different situations that we may typically encounter.
*[analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/pharmacophore-elucidation/6_2_0_1.png){: loading=lazy }

#### Common Structural Features: Rule 1

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/common-structural-features-rule-1-a03bac4c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The analysis of the structural features of a set of biologically active molecules acting with the same mechanism of action consists of identifying the structural elements that are essential for the activity of the molecules (pharmacophore). The comparison of structural features in molecules is a key topic in cheminformatics and is called "Molecular Similarity".
*[pharmacophore]: Specific 3D arrangement of chemical groups common to active molecules and essential to their biological activities.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/pharmacophore-elucidation/6_3_2_1.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Multiple Hypotheses: Rule 2

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/multiple-hypotheses-rule-2-a0c5f748'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button> The Identification of common structural features can lead to many hypotheses. The following active keys lead to three distinct hypotheses. Additional information needs to be generated in order to meet a unique solution.
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/pharmacophore-elucidation/6_4_2_1.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Inactive Molecules: Rule 3

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/inactive-molecules-rule-3-790e62db'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Inactive molecules may be of high informational content and play an important role in the analysis. In the example below the inactive molecules allow the refinement of the hypothesis.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/pharmacophore-elucidation/6_5_2_1.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Closely Related Molecules: Rule 4

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/closely-related-molecules-rule-4-3f893a9e'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Closely related molecules with similar properties are of poor informational content.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/pharmacophore-elucidation/6_6_2_1.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Molecules With No Common Features: Rule 5

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/molecules-no-common-features-rule-5-2bbbc03d'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Molecules that are structurally too diverse are difficult to be exploited. To get interpretable data the chemist must  generate molecules with  single structural modifications. When the molecules are structurally different, advanced cheminformatics  (conformational analyses) and in depth modeling analyses need to be done.
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/pharmacophore-elucidation/6_7_2_1.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Mapping the Receptor: Rule 6

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/mapping-receptor-rule-6-9025fa70'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The analysis of active/inactive molecules aims at generating a picture of the receptor enabling to understand its stereochemical requirements. For example if removing a structural element in the molecule leads to the complete loss of the biological activity, this may indicate the existence of an important interaction with the receptor.  If the introduction of an additional fragment in a molecule leads  to loosing its biological activity, this may indicate  the existence of a non-favorable interaction  with the receptor (e.g. steric bump).

## Conformational Control

### Control of the Molecular Geometries

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/control-molecular-geometries-6ad4057a'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Drug design analyses require perfect control of the conformational features of the molecules considered. The molecular modeler needs to have a perfect understanding of the conformational features in order to manipulate them with his own hands in 3D. For him the presence of structural features such as rings or rotatable bonds in the molecules should not present a problem. They must be under good control for analyzing the SAR (Structure-Activity Relationships) implications and later be utilized for the design stage. Advanced computerized tools can assist him. However, it is his ability to predict, modify, and anticipate the conformational behavior of a molecule's related analog that is of utmost importance.

Especially in a pharmacophore-based approach where very often the actual mechanism of action is a "black box", you might assume this is part of the working hypotheses - that the molecules actually act according to the same mechanism of action. This allows the comparison of the three-dimensional structures, and if convincing 3D structural similarities are found, this strengthens the validity of the working hypothesis.

The authors were very much disapointed: the molecules they synthesized did not have the expected activities and abandoned the hypothesis considering it as incorrect. However, it has been shown that what was incorrect was the molecules that were designed, not the hypothesis! The reconsideration of this hypothesis at the 3D level allowed the design of different molecules that were synthesized and showed to have very good biological activities!

The hypothesis was developed in 2D and then completed with 3D considerations, justified only with mechanical commercial models. The consequence of which was that tricyclic moieties with a "buterfly-like" shape were indispensable for the biological activities concerned. Precise computerized force-field minimizations invalidated this model and showed that the tricyclic moiety was not necessary at all. Non-tricyclic molecules were synthezized with a much more reduced pharmacophore which proved to have good biological activities (for the entire story go to E3.3.1 and the following pages).

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/two-boat-conformations-dihydropyridine-ring-722c56e1'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The dihydropyridine ring of nifedipine can exist in two alternative boat conformations. The nitrophenyl substituent can therefore be in either the axial or equatorial orientation.

#### Preferred Conformation of Nifedipine

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/preferred-conformation-nifedipine-a37a340f'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The preferred conformation of the nifedipine is where the phenyl substituent is in the axial orientation. In the methyl-4 nifedipine, the presence of the methyl group in position 4 modifies the conformational preference of the dihydropyridine ring (demonstrated by X-ray crystallography and by molecular mechanics) and the nitrophenyl group becomes equatorial.

### Judging with Discernment

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/judging-discernment-41d2c301'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The examples presented in the previous pages showed that the introduction of a methyl group in different regions of the same active molecule can lead to entirely inactive molecules. In both cases it was due to an improper molecular geometry. However, in one case it was due to the induction of a conformational change, whereas in the second case the overall conformation was satisfactory, but the receptor's pocket was not large enough.

### The Active Analog Principle
*[Analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/active-analog-principle-8b7e09a6'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>When almost nothing is known about the stereochemical requirements of the receptor, one can try to develop a systematic analysis aiming at their identification. This strategy is called 'receptor mapping'. The union of all active molecules indicates the 'receptor-excluded volume', which is the volume not occupied by the receptor itself.

Pharmacophores of the first generation were very simple consisting of only two or three elements; they still continue to be used. The second generation is more sophisticated. With color-coded cones, spheres and other volumes, they represent hydrogen-bond donors or acceptors, structural fragments, permitted/forbidden regions. The colors distinguish between hydrophobicity, polarity, polarizability, and ionicity.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='pharmacophore-elucidation/future-4047e93c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The concept of pharmacophore is continuously growing. The next generation will be an extension of the current situation, however translated in the space of numerical analyses with less emphasis on the visual aspects. A series of different numerical scoring functions will cover the whole space and control the different molecular features with their associated 3D distribution of physico-chemical properties such as: lipophilicity potential, electrostatic potential, dispersion forces, hydrogen-bond donors or acceptors, polarizability, ionicity, solvation, charge.
