## Rational Drug Design

### Drug Design Basis: Molecular Recognition

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/drug-design-basis-molecular-recognition-e03c1173'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Life is based on molecular systems that are organized and regulated by precise recognition and discrimination process. Insights into biological systems show us that all the underlying molecular machinery operates in three-dimension. This is the basis of rational drug design.

### Lock-and-Key Model

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/lock-and-key-model-8021da13'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In 1890 Emil Fischer proposed a model called the "lock-and-key model" that explained how biological systems function. A substrate fits into the active site of a macromolecule, just like a key fits into a lock. Biological 'locks' have unique stereochemical features that are necessary to their function.

### Induced-Fit Model

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/induced-fit-model-787ee11d'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>However, the lock-and-key model did not take into account the conformational changes that occur for both the ligand and the target macromolecule. An extension of this model was proposed by Daniel Koshland in 1958 and called the "induced-fit theory". This theory proposed that in the recognition process both ligand and target mutually adapt themselves by small conformational changes until an optimal fit is achieved.

### Rational Drug Design

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/rational-drug-design-414a2fb9'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Rational drug design exploits the detailed recognition and discrimination features that are associated with the specific arrangement of the chemical groups in the active site of a target macromolecule. New molecules that can optimally interact with the protein can be conceived to block or trigger a specific given biological action.

### Rational Drug Design Process

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/rational-drug-design-process-6a633b62'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Rational drug design proceeds in three steps. It begins with the design of compounds that conform to specific requirements. Then the molecules are synthesized and tested. Further rounds allow the refinement of a given scaffold and its optimization.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/receptor-based-drug-design-32b06c8f'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>If the three-dimensional structure of the target protein is known, this information can be directly exploited for the retrieval and design of new ligands.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/similarity-concepts-molecular-mimicry-8fcf8795'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In indirect design, the analysis of the active and inactive molecules gives a "feeling" of how structural variations can change biological properties and allows one to generate hypotheses about the interactions of the ligands with the receptor. For example, one might deduce: " This group is necessary; this substituent suppresses the biological activity in this series etc." This strategy consists of positioning the 3D relative location of the structural elements recognized in the active molecules as necessary in the structure of new chemical entities. This strategy is called "molecular mimicry".

### Typical Receptor-Based Project

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/typical-receptor-based-project-c5585e65'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The development of a drug candidate that inhibits a cancer-related protein was stopped due to insufficient selectivity. The X-ray data of the complex of the molecule with the protein concerned is available. This is a possible starting point for a receptor-based project aiming at the discovery of potent and selective molecules.

### Typical Genomic Project

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/typical-genomic-project-43036ea5'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>A gene having an adenine instead of a thymine has been shown to be at the origin of a particular hereditary disease resulting in obesity. This impaired gene encodes an aspartic protease which represents the first step of the cascade causing obesity. This is a typical starting point for a project derived from genomics and aiming at the discovery of anti-obesity non-peptidic agents that would be inhibitors of this protein.

## Perspectives

### Drug Discovery of the 1970's 

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/drug-discovery-1970s-c5a58ce2'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Since in the 1970's, no X-ray structure of a disease-relevant biological target was available, drug research was essentially based on the structures of active molecules (e.g. penicillin, steroids, peptides, alkaloids etc...).

### Drug Discovery of the 1980's

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/drug-discovery-1980s-04d84217'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In the 1980's, protein homology models were constructed to compensate for the lack of X-ray data in order to provide data for direct drug design of new molecules. Receptor-based drug design started to "take-off".

### Drug Discovery of the 1990's

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/drug-discovery-1990s-6e2ab087'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In the 1990's, recombinant DNA and cloning technologies greatly helped to the isolation and crystallization of many key biological targets. Many rational drug design projects were developed and based on the X-ray structure of a target protein (e.g. HIV-1, Renin, and Thrombin).

### The Present Situation

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/present-situation-3a73787a'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Presently the structural 3D features of many target proteins are available, increasing the number of projects where the receptor-based approach is used. However combinatorial chemistry and high through-put screening generate data that can be exploited in a pharmacophore-based perspective.

### Initial Skepticism Towards Rational Drug Design

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/initial-skepticism-towards-rational-drug-design-e6d60208'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Rational drug design has generated initial skepticism. The following published cartoon, illustrates the ironic attitude that it generated. The picture suggests that the rational approach intended to establish a correlation between the shape of the drop of water and the shape of the lock of the door!

### Success Stories in Rational Drug Design

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/success-stories-rational-drug-design-bfc65335'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Meanwhile, rational drug design has become a mature discipline and has proven to efficiently contribute to the drug discovery process. Today the number of success stories is so huge that it is impossible to review them in a single article. The examples presented in this course are all illustrations of how rational drug design has contributed to real achievements in drug discovery.

### Future Perspectives

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='drug-design/future-perspectives-5ed3c670'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Rational drug design is only at the beginning of its development and is progressing rapidly. Each of the disciplines mentioned is making its own spectacular progress. This indicates that new concepts and approaches will be soon in demand from computerized molecular design technologies. Rational drug design will be able to provide drug discovery with an entirely new dimension. The starting point and the data accumulated in a given project will be treated in a global perspective and will generate an unexpected synergy between projects that may appear unrelated.
