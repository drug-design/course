    When a new type of active compound is discovered, analogs are investigated to gain insights into its structure and to discover useful drug candidates. SAR analyses try to guide this process by converting structure-activity results into informative structure-activity relationships in molecular terms, and to ensure a good exploitation of this knowledge. This chapter presents the concepts underlying SAR and illustrates them with concrete examples.

## Introduction

### Structure Activity Relationships (SAR)
*[SAR]: Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR) is the analysis of the relationships between chemical structure and biological activity.

When a new type of active compound is discovered the chemist through alterations in its molecular structure, attempts to produce new compounds with similar, perhaps improved activity, or with other valuable active properties. At a given stage the effects observed are interpreted in terms of structural variations, which are then used to decide which modifications to consider next. Relating biological activities to molecular structures is known as structure-activity relationships (SAR).

### Aim of SAR Analyses
*[SAR]: Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR) is the analysis of the relationships between chemical structure and biological activity.

SAR analyses try to convert structure-activity observations into informative structure-activity relationships. They aim at maximizing the knowledge that can be extracted from the raw data in molecular terms, exploit this knowledge to identify which molecules should be synthesized and identify lead compounds for either additional modifications or further pre-clinical studies.

### Principle: Alteration of an Active Substance
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.

The progressive alteration of the molecular structure of a reference compound allows for the determination of the importance of the structural elements involved. This can be done by removing, adding or replacing specific molecular fragments and testing how the structural variation affects biological activities. For example, if the analog is inactive, the original functional group is interpreted as being essential to binding; if the activity is not affected, the original functional group is considered to be unimportant. Each of the novel molecules synthesized is expected to yield useful knowledge.

### Development: a Single Modification at a Time

Data of high informational content can be obtained when derived from single structural modifications of an initial lead structure. The introduction of multiple changes should be avoided because of the difficulties created for the correct interpretation of the biological results. The example below illustrates a molecule for which three alterations were introduced. In the absence of other SAR, the interpretation of the inactivity of the resulting molecule is impossible.

### Iterative Process

The approach proceeds with successive iterations. It starts with the analysis of the structure of the initial target molecule. Many questions are raised, for which the chemist can identify candidate molecules that may be able to provide answers to the questions. In parallel, he looks for a synthetic program that can generate valuable active candidates to be further fine-tuned in the subsequent loops.

### Chemical Modifications and Medicinal Chemist Tools

The tools that are available to the medicinal chemist are diverse. Depending on the structural fragments that captured his interest during the analyses, the synthetic program can involve chemical modifications such as those described below.

### Chemistry is the Limiting Factor

The implementation of the strategy is however biased by the actual synthetic possibilities; for example the systematic variation of all kind of substitutions in a ring is not always feasible. An intelligent program that allows for multiple variations in the final stage of the syntheses, although desirable is still biased, and covers only a small portion of the entire space of possible modifications.

### Role of the Functional Groups in the Reference Structure
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.

In current practice, many of the modifications that are implemented by medicinal chemists involve the functional groups of the reference compound. The systematic alteration of selected functional groups serves to probing their possible interactions with the receptor and to test their relevance to binding in terms of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic or polar interactions. This will be presented in the following pages.

## Probing H-Bond Interactions

### Principle for Probing Hydrogen Bond Interactions

The method for probing the existence of hydrogen bond interactions with a specific functional group consists of preparing analogs where the functional group concerned is unable to make hydrogen bonds.

#### Testing H-Bond Donor Capability of the Hydroxyl

To test whether a hydroxyl group is involved as a donor of hydrogen bonds, it is possible to alkylate the hydroxyl or to prepare the corresponding ketone. If the biological activity drops, one can conclude that this hydroxyl group is important and is likely to interact with the protein as a hydrogen bond donor.

#### Testing H-Bond Acceptor Capability of the Hydroxyl

It is difficult to simply test whether a hydroxyl group is involved as an acceptor of hydrogen bonds: no simple alterations can be envisaged that would disrupt the existing hydrogen bond (both the methoxy and the C=O analogs can still have their oxygen atom involved as a hydrogen bond acceptor).

#### Example 1: Pyrazolopyrimidines

In the following example, replacing the phenolic OH by a methoxy, leads to the complete loss of biological activity. The hydroxyl is likely to form a hydrogen bond with the receptor (as a hydrogen bond donor). Other factors including changes in the volume, the physico-chemical properties of the molecule such as the polar surface area, acidity, hydrophobicity, solubility, solvation etc... must also be envisaged.

#### Example 4: Salicylanilides

The replacement of the phenolic OH by a methoxy, leads to the complete loss of the biological activity: the hydroxyl is therefore important and is likely be involved as a hydrogen bond donor. But is it an intra-molecular hydrogen bond (fixing the conformation in a bioactive geometry) or a hydrogen bond that is formed with the receptor? Other factors including changes in the volume, the physico-chemical properties of the molecule such as the polar surface area, acidity, hydrophobicity, solubility, solvation etc... must also be envisaged.

#### Example 3: Aminoquinazolines

By comparing the amino-quinazoline and its N-Methyl analog, one could think of a H-bond interaction with the N-H. This is not true, as evidenced by the O and S analogs that retain good activities. In the N-Methyl analog, the aniline moiety cannot adopt the extended bioactive conformation (steric repulsions), and this has been proven by X-ray crystallography (see next sub-page).

### Carboxylates

For a molecule containing a carboxyl group and when the pH is much greater than the pK<sub>a</sub> of the corresponding acid, the carboxyl function exists primarily in its ionized, conjugate base form and can therefore establish ionic interactions with positively charged groups. Unless the structure of the complex with the receptor is known, it is not easy to prove the existence of salt-bridge interactions, either with analogs, or by measuring the biological activities at different pHs.

## Probing Other Interactions

### Halogens

Halogen atoms are able to produce various sorts of interactions. Directly, they may be implicated in hydrophobic or polar interactions; and indirectly they are able to change the polarity of contiguous atoms or conjugated systems (e.g. atoms of aromatic rings). Halogen interactions are observed with many groups (amino, cyano, nitro, imino and other halogen atoms) and also with &pi; systems such as Phe, His, Trp, Tyr.

In this example the substitution by a chlorine atom leads to a compound which is by far more potent than the unsubstituted derivative. This can be interpreted by the existence of an empty space corresponding to the volume of a chlorine atom. The introduction of a chlorine atom can increase the binding affinity by establishing additional van der Waals interactions with the protein. Other reasons may be due to changes in the volume, the conformation or in the physico-chemical properties of the molecule.

However, tertiary amides exist as a mixture of E and Z isomers: this is an important property of acyclic tertiary amides, which should not be overlooked when exploring SAR. Moreover, when the amide group is located in the center of the molecule, this situation can be exploited to explore the requirements of two entirely different regions of the receptor.

In the following example the tertiary amide analog is 30,000 times more potent than the secondary amide.

The Z stereochemistry was suspected to be the bioactive geometry of methyl-idenyl-indolin-2-one derivatives. To test this hypothesis the 4'-chlorine molecule (right), and the 4'-chlorine 1'-methyl derivative (left), were conceived with geometrical considerations that were confirmed to be correct. N.M.R. studies indicate a Z geometry that is favored by an internal hydrogen bond for the first molecule, and the E geometry for the second compound. The biological tests confirmed that a Z stereochemistry is needed for having active molecules.

It is worth noticing that for the structures of the previous page, there are no separate Z and E isomers: they are in equilibrium! In this conjugated system, the double bond becomes single in the enolic tautomer form 2, which then allows the rotation about this bond. The isomerization is thermodynamically controlled with an E/Z ratio depending on the energies of the two isomers (for the R group concerned).

The bioactive conformation for binding to the GABAc proved to correspond to the trans isomer. In the GABA series the trans (TACA) isomer is more potent than the cis (CACA); the inferior activity of GABA can be understood in terms of the free rotation around the central bond. In the methylphosphinic analogs it is also observed that the trans isomer (CGP44530) is more potent than the cis (CGP70523); however the good biological activity observed for the unsaturated CGP35024 is difficult to interpret.

### Complexity of the Structures Concerned
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.

Sometimes an elementary change (the replacement of an oxygen atom by a carbon, in the example below) cannot be interpreted easily. It may be due to a combination of many effects, such as for example the loss of an important intermolecular interaction, and/or the absence of an internal H-bond which favors the bioactive conformation, and/or changes in desolvation, pK<sub>a</sub>, etc..., where the activities cannot be understood in terms of elementary ligand-receptor interactions.

### Observations with no Explanations

SAR observations may be uninterpretable. This may arise from (1) insufficient informational content of the data; (2) the simplicity of our models; (3) our ignorance of other factors; (4) an experimental error. Until additional data allow for an acceptable solution to emerge, the SAR remain unclear. Look at the data below and try to explain the SAR; imagine new molecules to be synthesized that might contribute to providing an answer. A possible rationale is proposed in the associated sub-page.

### Local Changes and Global Consequences
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.

SAR analyses are based on the principle of independence: a local change is treated as not affecting the rest of the structure; however this is not always true. Sometimes a simple change in a molecule may completely change the property of the entire molecule (e.g. conformation) or its binding interaction (e.g. binding orientation). This is illustrated by a number of examples in the following pages.

#### Small Modification that Substantially Alters the Geometry

In the example shown below, a small structural modification, such as the replacement of the N-H by a N-CH<sub>3</sub> group, completely alters the conformational preference of the original molecule. This effect should not be overlooked when interpreting the biological activities of the two analogs.

#### Small Modification that Interferes with Other Interactions

In the example represented here, the introduction of a methyl group leads to the complete loss of biological activity. The methyl group hampers the formation of an essential hydrogen bond interaction that existed upon binding of the original compound. The impact of the local change that was made can only be understood by looking at the molecule as a whole.

#### Modification that Alters the Binding Orientation

By analogy with ATP, Olomoucine (an ATP competitive inhibitor of the protein kinase CDK2) was expected to have the same binding mode as found for ATP. However, X-ray studies demonstrated an entirely different binding mode for it (analyzed in detail in the chapter structure-based drug design: analysis). Such a drastic effect should not be overlooked when interpreting the biological activities of adenine-based inhibitors (this is analyzed in detail in the chapter structure-based drug design: analysis).

#### Change that Alters a Characteristic of the Substance
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.

A small alteration of a structure may introduce substantial changes in specific physico-chemical properties, with repercussions in the biological properties, which can be even more pronounced in-vivo. For example, the replacement of a carbon atom by an oxygen, or the change in the number of carbon atoms in a molecule can affect many properties of the substance. Examples of changes in pK<sub>a</sub> and logP are presented in the following pages.

##### pKa

The difference in the pK<sub>a</sub> values of cocaine analogs was called upon to explain the differences in their binding potencies: a high potency is associated with a high pK<sub>a</sub>. Note the considerable changes that occurred in the pK<sub>a</sub> values.

### Non Additivity of Biological Effects

Knowing the biological effects of mono-structural changes in a series does not make it possible to predict the biological activity of an analog containing multiple changes simultaneously. SAR often rely on the principle of additivity of the biological properties: however this is not always true. In the following pages some examples of non-additivity of biological effects are presented.

The norethisterone (NET) steroid was used as a starting point for SAR. The following single modifications were considered and led to compounds with increased potencies.

##### Additivity of Biological Effects

The introduction of two modifications simultaneously, leads to compounds with biological activities that are about the sum of those observed with single changes.

##### Non Additivity of Biological Effects

A compound twelve times more potent would be expected, when the three modifications are introduced simultaneously. In fact, the molecule is only nine times more potent than the initial reference steroid. In this example the biological effects are not simply additive.

#### Phenoxypyrimidines: Non Additivity

In the phenoxypyrimidine series, it has been observed that the mono-methyl substituted analogs at C-2 or at C-4 have biological activities close to that of the unsubstituted compound. On the contrary, the analog with the two methyl groups, is three times more potent.

### Being Trapped with Poor Biological Activities

The danger of being trapped in a series with poor biological activities is high when the receptor site is not known. When a lead is chosen, it is useful to make sure that the corresponding scaffold does not contain structural elements that are detrimental to the biological activities. It is worth spending some time addressing this issue before embarking on an SAR optimization program with a bad scaffold.

#### The Dioxobenzothiazole Scaffold

The dioxobenzothiazole scaffold has been the object of SAR studies, in a project aiming at the discovery of CDK4 kinase inhibitors. Starting with the unsubstituted derivative having an IC<sub>50</sub> of 6 &Mu;M, a series of analogs were prepared, whose activities remained in the same micromolar range.

#### Origin of the Problem

Now that the interactions of inhibitors with the CDK4 kinase are well understood, it is possible to interpret the origin of the problem as being due to steric and polar repulsions between the nitrogen atom of the thiazole and the carbonyl of the hinge. Note that another scaffold containing an N-H group in this position could be ideal for improving the biological activities!

### The Combinatorial Era

Our combinatorial chemistry-HTS era tends to generate what is sometimes called a "combinatorial chaos". Indeed computerized SAR programs are developed to handle this situation however the danger is to work with black-box-tools where the exact physico-chemical content diminishes. The real issue in SAR is to convert the data into useful knowledge that can be further exploited. Statistically-based programs cannot replace the creative and time consuming work needed to analyze SAR and extract this knowledge.

### The Banyu Story with the Urea Structure

Following a structure-based strategy, the Banyu group identified a hit (Cdk4 inhibitors project) having an urea moiety with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 44 &Mu;M. The hit was simplified (ortho substituent removed) in order to derive further knowledge based on SAR analyses. In the following pages an outline of the important steps that enabled successful exploitation of SAR is presented.

### Bioactive Conformation?
*[Bioactive Conformation]: The geometry adopted by a ligand when it binds to its biological target.

Based on modeling analyses the Banyu group suspected that the binding of the compounds involved the N-H and the carbonyl by forming two hydrogen bonds with the protein, in a bidentate manner. This hypothesis requires a "cis" conformation for the amide fragment concerned.

### Design of Compounds with a Cis Conformation

The aromatic phenyl was replaced by a pyridine, for all possible positions of the nitrogen atom (ortho, meta, para). The increased activity observed only for the 2-pyridyl isomer was interpreted as due to the increased population of the cis conformation (favored by an internal hydrogen bond).
