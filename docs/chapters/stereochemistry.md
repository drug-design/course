## Introduction

### Introduction on Stereochemistry

Stereochemistry is the study of the spatial arrangements of atoms in molecules. This arrangement affects the way it reacts in chemical reactions and its biological and physical properties.

### Bond Lengths

The bond length is determined by the nature of the atoms and the nature of the chemical bond.

### Bond Angles

Two successive bonds define a bond angle. The value of the bond angle depends on the nature and the hybridization of the atoms. Increasing the s-character of the central atom increases the bond angle.

#### Thorpe-Ingold Effect

The H-C-H angle in methane is 109.5<sup>o</sup>. The progressive substitution of the hydrogens by larger hydrocarbon groups result in the increase of the bond angle between the large ligands while the bond angle between the hydrogen atoms decreases (Thorpe-Ingold effect).

### Torsion Angles

The relative location of four successive atoms (1,2,3,4) in the chemical structure of a molecule is defined by the torsion angle of the two half planes (1,2,3) and (2,3,4).


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/stereochemistry/snap_v1_b3_1_4.png){: loading=lazy }

#### Torsion Angle Sign Convention

A +/- sign is assigned to the torsion angles: the back bond is kept fixed and the front bond is rotated so that it can superimposed on the fixed one. The torsion angle is positive if this rotation is clockwise and negative if it is counterclockwise.

#### Examples of Torsion Angles

Local geometrical features in a molecule are well described with the numerical values of selected torsion angles.

#### Torsion Angle Descriptor (sp3-sp3)

Several geometries are assigned to a torsion angle with a central sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3</sup> bond. In a staggered conformation the ligands can be in a (+) or (-) synclinal (+60<sup>o</sup>, -60<sup>o</sup>) or antiperiplanar (180<sup>o</sup>) orientation; whereas in an eclipsed form the ligands can be in a synperiplanar (0<sup>o</sup>) or a (+) or (-) anticlinal (+120<sup>o</sup>, -120<sup>o</sup>) orientation (click on Newman projections).

#### Torsion Angle Descriptor (sp2-sp3)

For torsion angles with a central sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>3</sup> bond, the favored conformers are geometries where a &Sigma; bond of the sp<sup>3</sup> atom is eclipsed with the &pi; bond of the sp<sup>2</sup> atom; this corresponds to six different geometries. (In this example the F-C-C-N torsion angle is rotated counterclockwise).

## Chirality

### Chirality

Chirality is a geometrical property of a rigid object when it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image; there are no symmetrical elements in the object (such as mirror plane or inversion center). A carbon atom holding four different ligands is a chiral center.

### Chirality Descriptor: Optical Rotation

Optical activity is the ability of a molecule to rotate the plane of polarized light. An optically active molecule causing rotation of the light in a clockwise direction is called dextrorotatory and a (+) is associated to its chemical name. A molecule causing rotation of the light in the counterclockwise direction is called laevorotatory and a (-) is associated to its chemical name. The optical rotation of a molecule is defined by the following formula:

### Chirality Nomenclature

An atom with four different ligands is chiral. Its absolute configuration can be assigned by the R/S Cahn-Ingold-Prelog method as follows: (1) assign priorities to the ligands from 1 (highest priority) to 4 (lowest priority); (2) rotate the molecule so that ligand number 4 is in the back; (3) if the direction for the numbers 1 to 3 is clockwise, assign R (rectus, RIGHT), if counterclockwise, assign S (sinister, LEFT).

#### The Order of Priority (3/5)

Double and triple bonds are assigned using a convention considering the functional group with the multiple bond to be equivalent to the same number of single-bonded atoms. For the C=O bond for example, the carbon-oxygen double bond is equivalent to the carbon atom being bonded twice to the oxygen atom; however, the duplicate ones (in parentheses in the views below) will be treated as "phantom" atoms.

### Examples of R/S Assignments (1/4)

Below is shown the 2D formula of Levodopa and let us assign the stereochemistry of the molecule. Following the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules the priorities assigned to the atoms connected to the chiral carbon are: 1 for the nitrogen, 2 for the carboxyl, 3 for the benzyl and 4 for the hydrogen atom. This levodopa compound is therefore with the S stereochemistry.

### The Newman Projection

In the Newman projection the molecule is viewed along the axis of a rotatable bond, generally a C-C &Sigma; bond. The front and back groups are connected differently to the central atoms: the lines are drawn to the center of the circle for the front atom and to the periphery of the circle for the rear atom. Newman projections are useful in describing the conformation of a molecule.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/stereochemistry/newman.gif){: loading=lazy }

### The Fischer Projection (1/3)

The Fischer projection is a flat stick drawing of the molecule which preserves information about chirality. The bonds of the carbon skeleton are shown vertical and other bonds are horizontal. The 3D structure can be reconstructed in the mind by imagining the vertical bonds to be below or behind the projection plane and horizontal bonds above or in front of that plane.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/stereochemistry/fischer.gif){: loading=lazy }

#### The Fischer Projection (2/3)

If more than one atom are chiral, then the Fischer projection can be used to describe their respective stereochemistries. In the example represented below the molecule contains two chiral carbon atoms.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/stereochemistry/fischer2.gif){: loading=lazy }

#### The Fischer Projection (3/3)

It is worth noticing that a Fischer projection is unique and cannot describe the conformation of a molecule (contrary to the Newman projections). The D-erythrose is presented here to illustrate this point. Note the difference between the 2D and one possible conformation of this molecule represented below, both in 3D and with a Newman projection.

### Chirality: D/L

For aminoacids and sugars the absolute configuration of chiral centers can be described with the D/L nomenclature based on Fischer's projections (see view). In aminoacids, if the amino group is on the left, it is assigned L, and when it is found on the right, it is assigned D. For sugars if the last chiral hydroxy is on the left, it is assigned L, and if it is on the right, it is assigned D.

### Chirality: Erythro/Threo

Special descriptors are used for acyclic structures having two stereo-chemical centers. It uses the Fischer projections together with the R/S stereo-chemistries of the individual chiral centers. If the stucture is RR or SS (like) then the whole is named 'threo', whereas for SR or RS (unlike) it is called 'erythro'.

### Other Examples of Chiral Molecules: Example 1

Chirality does not have to be associated only with sp3 carbon atoms. In the following pages we present different types of chiral molecules. In the example shown below we have a molecule with a quaternary nitrogen with two possible enantiomers: R and S.

#### Example 2 of Chiral Molecule

Phosphorous atoms can be chiral, in this case the lone pair is assigned with the lowest priority as the 4<sup>th</sup> ligand, and we have two possible enantiomers.

#### Example 3 of Chiral Molecule

A molecule is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. This situation occurs with allene compounds that exist as enantiomers. The two isomers are called "plus" (+) or "minus" (-) based on the following convention: ligands with the higher rank are identified on both ends of the allenic fragment and the molecule is viewed along the allenic direction. If the higher ranked ligands appear clockwise the allene is assigned with the (+) notation, and if they appear counterclockwise the molecule will be assigned (-).

#### Example 4 of Chiral Molecule

A similar situation is found in biphenyl compounds. For steric reasons the interconversion from one isomer to the other may be impossible at room temperature (ortho substituted analogs). A convention similar to the one presented for allenic molecules is used for describing the stereochemistry of biphenyl structures, with the notation (+) or (-) depending on the clockwise or counterclockwise location of the ligands.

## Double Bonds

### Cis-Trans Stereochemistry of Double Bonds

The cis/trans nomenclature describes the geometrical relationship between two ligands attached to two atoms that are either connected by a double bond or is part of a ring. The moiety is called 'cis' when the two ligands lie on the same side of the half plane that starts at the bond concerned and 'trans' when they are on opposite sides.

*[moiety]: Fragments, functional groups or portions of chemical compounds.

![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/stereochemistry/cis_trans.gif){: loading=lazy }

### E/Z Stereochemistry of Double Bonds

The cis/trans nomenclature cannot be used when there are 3 or 4 different ligands connected to the double bond. In this case it is necessary to assign the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities and compare the groups of highest priority for each atom. If the two ligands lie on the same side, "Z" (zusammen=together) is assigned; if they are on opposite sides, "E" (entgegen=opposite) is assigned.

### s-cis/s-trans Conformations

The designation s-cis and s-trans is for a fragment with two conjugated double bonds. "s-cis" is assigned if the two double bonds are on the same side and "s-trans" if the double bonds are on opposite sides.

### Re/Si Nomenclature of the Faces of Double Bonds

A double bond has two faces, which could be different. When facing the viewer, each atom of the double bond is assigned "re" (rectus) or "si" (sinister). In the case of a carbonyl, the re/si assignment is given only for the carbon atom of the double bond and based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules; when the two atoms have ligands, a re-re si-si or re-si si-re assignment is then necessary.

## Rings

### Rings

A n-membered ring with n-3 double bonds is planar. The most common descriptors of non-planar geometries of rings are chair, boat, twist-boat and crown.

#### Chair

The "chair" conformation of cyclohexane corresponds to a geometry where four atoms (1,2,4,5) are in a plane and two atoms (3,6) lie on opposite sides of this plane.

#### Boat

The "boat' conformation of cyclohexane corresponds to a geometry where four atoms (1,2,4,5) are in a plane and two atoms (3,6) lie on the same side of this plane.

#### Twist Boat

The "twist-boat" conformation of cyclohexane corresponds to a slightly distorted boat conformation (atoms 1,2,4,5 are no longer in a plane).

#### Crown

The crown conformation of a ring having an even number of atoms (8 or more) is defined by the regular alternation of the signs of its torsion angles. It is analogous to the chair conformation of cyclohexane.

### Rings: Axial and Equatorial Orientations

In a "chair" conformation, the substituents are 'axial' or 'equatorial' depending if their orientation is perpendicular or parallel to the mean plane of the molecule.

## Symmetry

### Introduction on Symmetry Operations

When treated as rigid objects with fixed structures, molecules contain internal symmetry elements. Symmetry operations are divided into two groups: the first preserves the geometry and includes Rotation (C<sub>n</sub>). The second group reverses the geometry and contains Reflection (&Sigma;), Inversion (i) and Rotatory reflection (S<sub>n</sub>).

### Symmetry C2

A C<sub>n</sub> symmetry axis exists in a molecule when a rotation of 360<sup>o</sup>/n leads to the same structure. For example, the following molecule has a C<sub>2</sub> symmetry axis, which corresponds to a rotation of 180<sup>o</sup>.

### Symmetry C3

The following molecule has a C<sub>3</sub> symmetry axis, which means that the structure remains the same after rotations of 120<sup>o</sup>.

### Symmetry Sigma

A molecule has a symmetry plane when all the elements on one side of the plane are the mirror image of the elements of the other side of the plane.

### Inversion (i)

A center of symmetry in a molecule is when all the atoms (x,y,z) can be inverted (-x,-y,-z). The center of symmetry (0,0,0) does not have to be an atom.

#### Example of Inversion

1,2-dibromo-1,2-dichloroethane has a center of symmetry in the middle of the carbon-carbon bond.

### Rotatory Reflection (Sn)

The rotatory reflection symmetry S<sub>n</sub> operation (where n is an even number) corresponds to a rotation of 360<sup>o</sup>/n followed by a reflection plane that is perpendicular to this axis. The following molecule has a S<sub>4</sub> symmetry (90<sup>o</sup>).
