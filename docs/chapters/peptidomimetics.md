## Introduction

### Key Peptides in Drug Discovery

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics/key-peptides-drug-discovery-d6032964'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Peptide molecules are an essential part of the biological processes. They act as substrates in many enzymatic reactions and can regulate the activation and inhibition of many biological pathways. As such, peptides are attractive targets as therapeutic drugs and drug-leads (see examples below). Furthermore, if one starts with a peptidic substance, it is relatively easy to find new peptidic analogs that are also biologically active.

### Definition of Peptidomimetics
*[Peptidomimetics]: Compounds that are peptide mimetics. They have non-peptide structures in part or in full, and mimic the the pharmacological activity of peptides.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics/definition-peptidomimetics-be4e6ee3'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Drug development sometimes requires the imitation of a reference peptide molecule. "Peptido-mimicry" or peptidomimetics is defined as the process of mimicking the biological properties of a peptidic substance.

### Problems with Peptide Molecules

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics/problems-peptide-molecules-9afe16d2'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>However, peptide compounds cannot be developed as drugs. Despite the excellent biological tests demonstrated in the laboratory, peptide molecules yield very poor results when the molecules are entered in clinical trials. The reason is that poor pharmacokinetics (including rapid proteolysis, metabolism, poor transport properties and rapid excretion) hinder the development of peptide and peptide-like molecules. In summary, peptidic molecules are:
*[pharmacokinetics]: The study of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of bioactive compounds.
*[pharmacokinetic]: The study of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of bioactive compounds.

### The Aim of Peptidomimetics
*[Peptidomimetics]: Compounds that are peptide mimetics. They have non-peptide structures in part or in full, and mimic the the pharmacological activity of peptides.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics/aim-peptidomimetics-0aa311c2'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The aim of peptidomimetics is to find a non-peptidic molecule that mimics the action of a reference peptide ligand. A non-peptidic structure has also the advantage of providing the structural diversity necessary to allow optimization of specificity, oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties. Also, in identifying an alternate series with different pharmacological properties, peptido-mimicry provides a powerful tool for creating proprietary molecules with a strong patent position.
*[bioavailability]: The percentage of drug that is detected in the systemic circulation after its administration.
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.
*[pharmacokinetic]: The study of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of bioactive compounds.
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.
*[peptidomimetics]: Compounds that are peptide mimetics. They have non-peptide structures in part or in full, and mimic the the pharmacological activity of peptides.
*[sar]: Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR) is the analysis of the relationships between chemical structure and biological activity.

### Typical Peptidomimicry Projects

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics/typical-peptidomimicry-projects-a4fcb3cf'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The following steps have been taken in many typical peptidomimicry projects: knowing the structure of a peptide molecule (a substrate or a hit from a phage-display library), a systematic synthetic chemistry program permitted the discovery of active small peptide analogs. Active peptide molecules can be easily discovered, however the question is how to make out of it a useful drug?

## Two Alternative Routes

### From Peptides to Non-peptidic Molecules

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics/from-peptides-to-non-peptidic-molecules-aa61769b'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The entire spectrum of molecules is schematically represented in the following diagram. The initial peptide reference structures are on the left side while the ideal non-peptidic structures are located on the right side of the spectrum. The greater the distance, the less peptidic the molecule is. There are two routes for such transformations, which will be described in the next pages.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics/range-structural-modifications-328378de'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>From a structural point of view, a peptide mimic can be designed by approaches ranging from relatively conservative replacements to more drastic modifications. Examples of selected approaches are demonstrated in the following pages. Each of these approaches can be the end-point of a peptidomimetic project or just one step in a sequence of modifications aiming at reducing the peptidic character.

The bridges, can be of various lengths and can link two side chain atoms, two backbone atoms, or a side chain atom and a backbone atom.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics/long-range-cyclizations-ec4313df'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Global restrictions of the peptide conformation are possible by limiting the flexibility of the peptide strand through cyclizations. In order to retain the biological activity, cyclic constraints should act on the backbone conformation to allow crucial side-chain interactions with the receptor to be strengthened.

For example it is possible to replace the C&alpha; with a nitrogen atom (to give azapeptides) or a boron (to give borapeptide), and also consider mono or di-substitutions of the &alpha;-carbon atom (synthetic non-coded amino acids).

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics/tetra-substituted-amino-acids-9d664332'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Tetra substituted amino acids are widely used in peptidomimetics for their conformational properties that are restricted by steric effects with the substituents. When inserted into a peptide chain, most of the tetra substituted amino acids are strong promoters of folded and helical conformations such as &beta;-turns, &alpha;-helices and 3<sub>10</sub>-helices. Here we present some typical situations.

##### Azapeptides

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics/azapeptides-3fc636d2'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Azapeptides have emerged as another important class of biologically stable and conformationally constrained backbone mimics. Aza amino acids provide a unique conformational property to the peptide backbone because of a chiral center loss (the &alpha;-carbon) and the extension of the area of planarity as compared with that of a normal amide bond. It was found that this more constrained backbone is limiting the peptide conformations to &beta;-turn like conformations and helical structures.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics/extension-peptide-chain-3060fe70'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The extension of the peptide backbone is another way to make a peptide mimic which is resistant to proteolytic enzymes. An extended backbone structure introduces additional degrees of torsional freedom as compared to the two degrees of the &alpha;-amino acids. However, the conformational space of the combined torsion angles is quite limited and thus, well conceived oligomers can adopt well-defined secondary structures such as helices, turns, and small sheet like structures. Such oligomers and other polymers that tend to adopt specific compact conformations are known as foldamers.

## The Challenge of Peptidomimicry

### Challenges in Peptide Modifications

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics/challenges-peptide-modifications-c430a3f7'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The successive modifications of the structure of a reference peptide are feasible. The advantages of this approach are multiple: a number of biologically active molecules are generated; they shed light on the structural requirements for biological activities; and they pave the road for deciding which molecules to synthesize next. 
 This approach requires however a continuous effort of chemical syntheses. The accumulation of active molecules may nurture the illusion that the breakthrough is "just around the bend". However in this approach it is difficult to assess if substantial progress was made until real clinical trials indicate the exact situation. 
 If it succeeds, the knowledge gained can be easily transposed to other similar projects. If it fails, the structural information acquired is of great value for considering a de novo design strategy for non peptidic mimics.

### Challenges in Non-Peptidic Mimicry

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics/challenges-non-peptidic-mimicry-7aa49e2e'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The de novo design strategy for non-peptidic mimics is an alternative approach for utilizing the information acquired on the reference peptide. When a non-peptidic compound is discovered, its scaffold provides the necessary framework to optimize specificity, oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties. 
Advanced computerized molecular design technologies are useful for exploiting optimally the information available and for the design and the synthetic efforts that have to be developed in an integrated manner. Sufficient time might be needed before the breakthrough occurs and patience is needed when inactive molecules are obtained.

### Perspectives in Peptidomimetics
*[Peptidomimetics]: Compounds that are peptide mimetics. They have non-peptide structures in part or in full, and mimic the the pharmacological activity of peptides.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='peptidomimetics/perspectives-peptidomimetics-d368e46c'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>There is no systematic method for transforming a peptide into a substance for drug development. In the past, medicinal chemists tended to embark on the process of making analogs of the peptide rather rapidly, hoping to find within a reasonable amount of time a compound with entirely different pharmacokinetic properties. 

Today since many success stories on de novo peptidomimicry have been reported, this approach has become more accepted. Currently, this trend encourages the development of sophisticated computerized packages allowing the enormous amount of experimental data accumulated in the course of many projects to be exploited in a global way.

 This encourages the creation of entirely new conditions for drug design and the definition of an entirely new way of considering lead discovery.
