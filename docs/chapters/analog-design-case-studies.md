## Case Study-1 : Salicylanilides

### Salicylanilides

The story of the design of a new type of EGF-R protein kinase inhibitors by Novartis is presented here. The quinazoline compound such as 1 (AstraZeneca) is a very potent EGF-R protein kinase inhibitor. Two possible hypotheses for the binding mode of this type of structure are discussed in the section "introduction to protein-ligand binding" however the work that is presented here can be understood independently of the exact mode of binding of this molecule. The structure of this molecule was modified by scaffold morphing, as explained in the following pages.
*[inhibitor]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[inhibitors]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.
*[binding mode]: Orientation and geometry adopted by a chemical substance when it is bound to its receptor.

### Genistein Structure and Alignment with Quinazoline 1

The isoflavone genistein 2 is an unselective inhibitor of EGF-R protein kinase. The Novartis group observed that this structure superimposes well with that of the AstraZeneca quinazoline inhibitor 1. Moreover, the alignment reveals that a pseudo six-membered ring can be seen in the structure of genistein that mimics the pyrimidine ring of 1.

### 3D Design of a Salicylanilide Scaffold

The analysis shown on the previous page prompted the Novartis team to consider a salicylanilide scaffold such as 3 (see button "2D") as a mimic of the quinazoline molecule 1. The formation of a strong hydrogen bond between the phenolic hydroxyl, and the carbonyl of the amide group in the salicylanilide structure maintains the molecule in the desired geometry.

### Possible Intramolecular H-Bonds in Salicylanilides

Conformational analyses show that there are two possibilities of intramolecular H-bonds in the salicylanilide structure (3a and 3b). The high probability of the existence of the 3a conformation that mimics the molecular geometry of the AstraZeneca inhibitor 1 well, encouraged the Novartis team to consider the synthesis of several analogs of the salicylanilide structure.

### Synthesis of the Molecules

About 30 analogs were synthesized; most of the analogs were prepared by reacting the corresponding salicyl acid with the intermediate formed from 3-chloroaniline with phosphorus trichloride. The synthesis used for the biphenylic anilide 28 is described below.

### Biological Assays

The results obtained for certain compounds are shown below. Potent EGF-R kinase inhibitors that have an IC50 between 23 and 71 nM were found. Compounds that do not have a free phenolic hydroxyl group (such as 10 and 11) capable of making the intramolecular hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of the amide are not active.

### Validity of the Hypotheses

The results confirmed the validity of the hypothesis that involved mimicking the AstraZeneca quinazoline by a salicylanilide structure. The two compounds have similar molecular geometries due to the existence of a pseudo-ring in the salicylanilide structure with a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond that maintains the proper geometry for the molecule.

### Summary

The good superimposition in 3D of the structures of the AstraZeneca inhibitor 1 and genistein 2 revealed the mimicry of a pseudo-ring of genistein with the pyrimidine ring of 1. Following up on that observation, a salicylanilide scaffold 3 was imagined having the same molecular geometry as 1. This led to the discovery of a new class of potent EGF-R kinase inhibitors.

## Case Study-2 : Pyrimidin-4-yl-ureas

### Pyrimidin-4-yl-ureas

Novartis discovered a novel class of kinase inhibitors having a pyrimidin-4-yl urea chemotype. This structure was developed by P. Furet at Novartis through modeling. This molecule was designed by "scaffold morphing", a design process consisting of the progressive replacement of a real ring present in a reference lead compound by a pseudo ring. This is presented in the following pages.

### PD-166285 Reference and Novartis Design
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.

PD-166285 is a potent protein kinase inhibitor with a broad spectrum of activities and Novartis was interested in using this structure as a template to design new kinase scaffolds. The Novartis team realized they could move one nitrogen atom of the pyrazine heterocycle, and replace the pyrimidone ring by an urea moiety in order to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond which would maintain a global molecular geometry similar to that of the reference lead (see figure).

### A Search in the Cambridge Structural Database
*[Cambridge Structural Database]: The "Cambridge Structural Database". A worldwide repository source of experimental data on the X-ray structures of small molecules.

To test whether this type of molecular geometry can be found in small molecules, a search in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) using a pyrimidin-4-yl urea substructure was made. The search returned seven hits, that all had an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the pyrimidine ring and the urea.

### Ab-Initio Calculations

Ab-initio calculations were made to assess the difference in energy between the extended and the folded pseudo-cyclic conformations of the model compound indicated below. The calculations in the gas phase showed that the pseudo-cyclic conformation was the most stable by 3.2 kcal/mol (populations at room temperature: 77% - 23%). When the calculations were made in water solution, the pseudo-cyclic form was favored by 0.5 kcal/mol (populations: 55% - 45%). This indicated that there would be no energy cost to pay for conformational adaptation to a kinase site.

### Correlation of the Activities with Size of Gate Keeper

The existence of tight binding of the pyrimidin-4-yl urea with the c-Abl threonine gatekeeper prompted the Novartis team to analyze the nature of the gatekeeper residues in the different kinases. They found a good correlation between the biological activities and the volume of the gate keeper. Protein kinases having a gate keeper larger than threonine cannot be active.

### P&#38;G Discovered Independently the Same Molecule

It is interesting to note that the Procter and Gamble group independently discovered the same kinase inhibitor 1 (optimized as an Lck kinase inhibitor), as Novartis. They started their project by screening against Lck, several analogs of a hit found by HTS for another project (TNF-&alpha;), and having a trisubstituted urea structure.

#### Optimization Towards Lck Kinase Inhibition

A hit with a modest inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 3.86 &Mu;M) was found. The systematic modification of the structure of this initial hit led to the preparation of about 40 analogs. Low nanomolar inhibitors of the Lck protein kinase were found, one of them corresponded exactly to the Novartis molecule 1.

### Summary

Based on modeling considerations, Novartis designed a mimic of a pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one scaffold (PD-166285) by moving the nitrogen atom and replacing the pyrimidone ring by a urea moiety, in order to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond that preserved the molecular geometry unchanged. The molecule was synthesized and proved to inhibit several protein kinases at the nanomolar level. At the same time, the same molecule was discovered independently by Procter &#38; Gamble, based on the systematic modification of a structure discovered by HTS.

## Case Study-3 : Anthranilamide Scaffold

### Anthranilamide Scaffold

Here we present the story of the design of a new type of structure by P. Furet at Novartis and created through modeling and scaffold morphing. The story starts with the discovery of the anilinophtalazine compound 1. The molecule was discovered by HTS and found to be a potent KDR and Flt-1 protein kinase inhibitor. It was subjected to clinical trials under the name of PTK-787.

### Structural Determinants of Anilinophtalazine Activity ?

When the anilinophtalazine lead was discovered, nothing was known about the structural determinants behind its good biological activities. The Novartis team addressed the following questions: what is the bioactive conformation of the molecule and what is the importance of the two nitrogen atoms of the phtalazine heterocycle?

### Conformational Analyses

To determine the nature of the bioactive conformation, a conformational analysis study was carried out by Novartis modelers to assess the preferred conformation of the molecule. The calculations indicated two possible orientations of the aniline moiety (syn and anti), with respect to the phtalazine nucleus in 1. The "anti" conformation was preferred and the difference in energy between the "syn" and "anti" conformers was 3.1 kcal/mol (populations 77% and 23%).

### Bidentate Binding Mode Unlikely to Occur
*[Binding Mode]: Orientation and geometry adopted by a chemical substance when it is bound to its receptor.
*[Bidentate]: Having two anchorage points

Experimental and modeling studies reveal that most protein kinase inhibitors bind to the hinge region of the enzyme involving H-bond donor/H-bond acceptor bidentate binding. The Novartis team saw that the anilinophtalazine could bind according to this classical mode if the molecule took on the syn conformation; however this form has relatively high energy. They concluded that it would be more advantageous to pursue analyses with the "anti" conformation.

### Role of the Nitrogen Phtalazine Atoms

If the bioactive conformation of 1 is likely to be "anti", this means that the anilino NH and the H-bond donor/H-bond acceptor system are not involved in the bidentate binding to the kinase. This prompted the Novartis team to explore the role of the two nitrogen atoms of the phtalazine heterocycle in greater depth.

### Database Searching

A database search was undertaken to identify similar structures lacking one or both phtalazine nitrogen atoms, but no hits were found. Another hypothesis was tested by the Novartis team by mimicking the pyridazine ring of phtalazine by the pseudo-cycle of a structure possessing an intramolecular hydrogen bond. A search in the Novartis corporate database using the anthranilic acid amide query structure indicated below (second button) gave one single hit. This compound was tested biologically and showed good activity for KDR and Flt-1 kinase inhibition.

The most important is the intramolecular H-bond between the aniline N-H and the benzanilide C=O that favors the conformation which mimics the reference bicyclic anilinophtalazine structure. The oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of the benzanilide mimics the N2 nitrogen atom of the phtalazine.

### Determinants for Anilinophtalazine KDR/Flt-1 Activities

These results suggested the following determinants for anilinophtalazine KDR/Flt-1 kinase inhibitory activities: (1) the bioactive conformation of the anilinophtalazine structure is the "anti" conformation; (2) the nitrogen atom N2 is important whereas (3) the nitrogen atom N3 is not important.

### Summary

Theoretical analyses made on an anilinophtalazine HTS lead 1 and exploited by an intelligent design were followed up by a database search that enabled the identification of an anthranilamide chemotype kinase inhibitor hit. This prompted the synthesis of the exact mimic of the initially designed molecule 3; it proved to be active at the nanomolar level. The design was made with structure-based reasoning and the work required the biological test of only one hit and the synthesis of only one compound !

### Requirements for Binding to the BZD Receptor

Diazepam 1 and estazolam 2 are potent benzodiazepine receptor antagonists. Structure-activity relationships of benzodiazepine ligands indicate that the following two features are needed for binding to the benzodiazepine receptor: (1) an aromatic ring, and (2) a coplanar proton-accepting group at the proper distance. Moreover, it has been shown that a second out-of-plane aromatic ring can provide additional potency for binding to the receptor.

### Design of Rigid Analog
*[Analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold

Analog 2 was designed by replacing the pyrazole N-2 of rimonabant by a carbon atom, and making a six-membered ring between this atom and the carboxamide nitrogen, to freeze the geometry of the molecule. The docking of 1 to a model of the CB-1 receptor shows that the carboxamide nitrogen atom is not involved in a hydrogen-bond with the receptor, and this supports the idea of designing a constrained analog.

## Case Study-8 : Salicylamide Mimics

### Salicylamide Mimics

Salicylamide 1 is a competitive inhibitor of the scytalone dehydrase. Hodge and Pierce exploited its structure to design potent mimics of this inhibitor. The structure of this molecule was transformed by scaffold morphing, as explained in the following pages.

#### Analyzing if Ortho Electron Lone-Pair is Sufficient

When the hydroxyl of 1 is replaced by a fluoro, amino, acetamido or methoxy, the inhibitory activity decreases by more than two orders of magnitude. This indicates that an electron lone-pair at the ortho-position is insufficient to explain the observed activities and the hydroxyl group is necessary for good inhibitory activity.

#### Potent Inhibition at Ki at Different pH

The affinity of 1 against the scytalone dehydrase was measured at different pH. The authors found that the neutral form of 1 binds 30-fold more tightly to the enzyme than the deprotonated anionic form. This once again demonstrates the importance of the phenolic hydroxyl group; moreover the OH needs to be in its neutral form.

### Pseudo-Ring of 1 Binds as a Whole Unit

### Design of Quinazoline Mimic

With the aim of stabilizing the salicylamides to metabolic deactivation, Hodge and Pierce imagined the replacement of the pseudo-ring of 1 by the pyrimidine ring of a quinazoline molecule such as 2. Through kinetic studies, they demonstrated that the two inhibitors 1 and 2 have similar potencies and bind to the enzyme in their neutral form. Removing one of the two nitrogen atoms in the quinazoline structure 2 yields molecules such as 3 and 4 that are much less active.

### Conclusion

The results shown here suggest that the scytalone enzyme recognizes the pseudo-ring of salicylamide 1 as a whole intact block. This observation might be general and valid for other proteins.

#### Retaining the two N-H groups

Analogs of 1 and the resulting SAR data indicated that it was necessary to retain the two N-H bonds, the N-acyl group, and its geometrical proximity to the biphenyl region. A simple way to do so was to connect the N-acyl group and the biphenylamine with an ethylene linker (prototype A).

#### Mimicking the Nitrogen Pyridine Atom by a Carbonyl

It was also imperative to retain a heteroatom in the region occupied by the nitrogen atom of the pyridine. A carbonyl group was therefore introduced to mimic the nitrogen atom and ensure potential lone pair interactions (prototype B). Moreover, the carbonyl was introduced to reduce the basicity of the benzylic amine in A to achieve closer resemblance to the diaminopyridine structure.

#### Conformational Considerations

Because analog B was unlikely to adopt a conformation with a molecular geometry similar to that of 1, the Thorpe-Ingold effect was considered, leading to the possibility of adding a gem-dimethyl group at the C alpha position (prototype C) to facilitate the rotation about the CO-C alpha bond and increase the population of the target conformer mimic.

In order to mimic the molecular geometry of 1, structure C must have a torsion angle &Phi;(N-C-C-N) close to 0&#176;. This is evidenced by the low activity of 3 (preferred torsion angle of 180&#176;) and the higher activity of 2 (preferred gauche torsion angle).

#### Smaller Rings have Increasing &pi; Character

Another factor that explains the observation of increased activities when reducing the size of the ring is that smaller rings have a higher p character (cyclopropyl groups are often seen as equivalent to a double bond). Therefore, there are &pi;-&pi; overlaps between the carbonyl and the cyclopropyl groups, an overlap that is maximal when the two groups are coplanar. This constitutes an additional reason why the cyclopropylamino acid amide group is a good pharmacophoric replacement for the 2,3-diaminopyridine.

#### Ring Strain and Geometry of Cyclopropyl

The ring strain existing in the cyclopropyl ring contributes to increasing the mimicry with the diaminopyridine fragment. The explanation is the following: the bond angle between the geminal substituents becomes closer to 116&#176; (Thorpe-Ingold effect), instead of the normal tetrahedral value 109&#176;. This increases the geometrical similarity with the sp<sup>2</sup> bond angles of 120&#176; found in the diaminopyridine core.

#### Bulkiness of the Hydrophobic Ring

Another reason enabling cyclopropyl analog 9 to adopt a conformation more similar to 1 more easily is the bulkiness of the ring. With a 3-membered ring, the steric effects are minimal and enable the N-acyl group to adopt a conformation similar to that found in 1.

### 3D Alignment of 1 and the Cyclopropyl Surrogate

Below is shown the good 3D overlap of the reference diaminopyridine structure with that of the cyclopropylamino acid amide. This explains why the cyclopropylamino acid amide is a good surrogate of the 2,3-diaminopyridine moiety.

### Summary

To circumvent toxicity problems of a 2,3-diaminopyridine bradykinin antagonist, the Merck group designed a cyclopropylamino acid amide surrogate. To achieve this good mimicry, the group took into account the geometric, conformational, stereoelectronic and physicochemical features of the structures. The antagonists displayed low nanomolar affinity for the human bradykinin receptor and good oral bioavailability in the rat.

*[Inhibitors]: Chemical substance that blocks or suppress the activity of a given enzyme.

After the good results obtained with bradykinin antagonists, the Merck team envisaged replacing the 2,3-diaminopyridine moiety by a cyclopropylamino acid amide, to see whether this replacement could also be valid for this project. The replacement of the 2,3-diaminopyridine in molecule 12 by a cyclopropyl acid amide yielded compound 13 with a Ki of 175 nM.

### Surrogates Generated by Computer

It is interesting to note that Paul Hawkins (OpenEye Scientific Software Inc.) used the Brood program to find bioisoteres of 2,3-diaminopyridine and found the same replacement as discovered by the Merck team. Some of the hits generated by the program are represented below. Note that cyclopropylcarbonyl is ranked in position 4. Other programs also exist that can be used along the same lines (see section on bioisosterism) and be exploited for scaffold morphing.
