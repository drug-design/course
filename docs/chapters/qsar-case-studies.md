<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar-case-studies/example-capsaicin-analogs-51f47d5f'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Capsaicin analogs were studied for their analgesic properties and we will use this study to illustrate the derivation of a simple QSAR model. The biological activities (EC<sub>50</sub>) were measured for some analogs as indicated below. The question is whether on the basis of these data, it is possible to develop a QSAR model and predict the biological activities of new compounds.

### Relevant Descriptors of Capsaicin Analogs
*[Analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold

For Capsaicin analogs, biological activity appears to be influenced by the lipophilicity of the substituent R. Following this assumption the descriptors deemed most suitable are the molar refractivity (MR) and the hydrophobic substituent constant &pi;.

### Predicting the CBG Affinities of New Steroids

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='qsar-case-studies/predicting-cbg-affinities-new-steroids-c3f5c445'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>The 3D-QSAR equation derived by CoMFA was used to predict the binding affinities to the human CBG receptor of these 10 new steroids leading to a predictive r<sup>2</sup> value of 0.65; if compounds 1, 9 and 10 are removed from this analysis, r<sup>2</sup> increases to 0.81. The steroid data set presented here has now become a standard set for the validation of any novel 3D-QSAR approach.
