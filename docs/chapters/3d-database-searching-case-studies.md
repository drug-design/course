!!! Info
    Successful examples of 3D database searching are presented and discussed. They show how 3D searching can be used either alone, or in combination with structure-based searching to discover hits with a good potential. These examples demonstrate that when good models are developed 3D database searching can lead to the rapid discovery of lead compounds with a minimum of additional synthetic chemical effort.

### Combined Pharmacophore and Structure-Based Searching
*[Pharmacophore]: Specific 3D arrangement of chemical groups common to active molecules and essential to their biological activities.

Initially the pharmacophore search generated a great number of hits. These hits were then subjected to structure-based screening to identify compounds that had effective interactions with the receptor. Finally, top-ranked compounds were defined as those with structural novelty, based on comparisons with the known D3 ligands. The most promising structures were selected for experimental biological testing.

### Results of the 3D Searching

Using the NCI 3D database of 250,200 "open" compounds, 6727 hits were identified by the 3D pharmacophore screening, 2478 successfully passed the structure-based screening and 1314 of them remained after the structural novelty screening. Twenty of them were selected for testing their activities: four of them were found with Ki values between 11 and 63 nM. Seven others were found with sub-&Mu;M activities.

### Summary

The approach presented here combined pharmacophore and structure-based searching, which helped discover potent ligands of the D3 receptor. The molecules shown below were discovered as hits that existed in the database; they did not require the development of a synthetic program. This type of methodology may be more effective than using 3D pharmacophore screening alone.

### Summary

In this example 3D database searching permitted the emergence of an idea (the consideration that a cyclic scaffold can mimic both the peptide backbone and the structural water). This idea was further exploited by combining structure-based drug design and chemical creativity (see scheme below). 3D database searching is a method of choice for generating new ideas, with the advantage that 'hits' do not need to be available in the stockroom.

### Pharmacophore Model
*[Pharmacophore]: Specific 3D arrangement of chemical groups common to active molecules and essential to their biological activities.

A 3D pharmacophore was derived that exploited the information from the SAR. Based on an initial pharmacophore shown on the left side, no hits were obtained. The model was therefore modified by replacing (1) the fucose unit by a carboxylic acid (for calcium binding); (2) the negatively charged sulfonic group was replaced by a carboxylic acid and (3) the branched alkyl chain was replaced by a single aliphatic chain.

### Results of 3D Searching

The modified pharmacophore yielded 3, a molecule that showed inhibitory activity against E-selectin. Despite its inferior biological activity as compared to the reference compounds, this hit was considered of sufficient interest for further improvements, because of its non-sugar structure.

### Optimization of the Diphenyl Ether Hit

Aligning the 3D structures of 1 and 3 revealed an unfavorable repulsion in the hit between the carboxylic acid of the benzoic acid moiety and a carboxylic acid of the isophtalic fragment. In addition, based on the X-ray structure of E-Selectin, modeling analyses indicated that one carboxylic acid of the isophtalic acid moiety did not contribute to the binding.

### Optimization of the Diphenyl Ether Hit

These observations suggested that one carboxylic acid of the isophthalic acid moiety might be removed. As the decarboxy derivative of 3 could not be synthesized, the related analog 4 was prepared with the intention of testing this hypothesis in this series. Compound 4 proved to have a very weak biological activity.

### The Dopamine Transporter Target

The work presented in this topic was carried out by the group at the University of Michigan to find a replacement therapy for cocaine addiction. They took the dopamine transporter (DAT) as a molecular target after obtaining biological results showing that cocaine binds to DAT, and other data suggesting that drugs that bind to biogenic amine transporters, including DAT, might be effective in combating cocaine addiction.

### Methodology: 3D Database Searching

A 3D database approach was used in which successive pharmacophore models were utilized and refined. The search was based on either the Available Chemical Directory (ACD), or the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 3D databases containing readily available molecules that can be biologically tested quickly. We start by presenting the first pharmacophore model.

#### 3D Searching Results with the First Pharmacophore
*[Pharmacophore]: Specific 3D arrangement of chemical groups common to active molecules and essential to their biological activities.

Searching in the NCI 3-D database of "open" compounds led to the identification of molecules in line with the first hypothesis. The piperidinol (2), the quinuclidine (6) and the phenyl-4 piperidine (12) compounds proved to inhibit the activity of the DAT protein at the micromolar range. Below, we describe the attempts made by the group at the University of Michigan for each of these to obtain more potent compounds.

Hits were found with the first pharmacophore model however, their optimization failed to result in nanomolar activities. Using the fact that very potent known DAT inhibitors such as 12, 13, 14, 15 do not have a carbonyl fragment, the Michigan group tried to assess the validity of the pharmacophore hypothesis, which includes a carbonyl moiety.

#### Structural Analyses of the Quinuclidine Hit

In particular, the Michigan group tried to identify which of the two nitrogen atoms of the quiniclidine hit mimics the one in cocaine. Modeling analyses indicated that the two hypotheses could be envisaged, but the 3D views revealed that in both cases, the remaining fragments of the two molecules did not overlap well (Sup1 and Sup2).

#### What Can Be Learned So Far?

The first part of this story illustrates that: (1) it is useful to challenge a current hypothesis; (2) an incorrect 3D pharmacophore hypothesis can possibly lead to useful results. This is shown by the 3D searching process, which generates molecules that have certain 3D similarities with the reference active molecule from which the pharmacophore was derived.

### Second Pharmacophore
*[Pharmacophore]: Specific 3D arrangement of chemical groups common to active molecules and essential to their biological activities.

The Michigan group continued to search for novel DAT inhibitors. Instead of using the cocaine molecule as a reference, they used the structure of the piperidinol compound 3 they had already discovered. Its 3D structure was therefore used to define a second 3D pharmacophore model.

#### What Can Be Learned So Far?

It seems only logical to ask why the Michigan group used the piperidinol inhibitor, since there are DAT inhibitors that are a hundred times more potent. The real reason is that they wanted to exploit their piperidinol hit to find another scaffold that could be easily optimized. This strategy failed, however: the optimized compounds were not potent enough.

Because they needed more potent compounds, the Michigan group considered a third pharmacophore model, based on the structure of a drug currently used for the treatment of opioid-induced sedation: Mazindol (note that this compound represents another class of inhibitors that has a different mode of interaction with DAT, as compared to cocaine).

### Fourth Pharmacophore
*[Pharmacophore]: Specific 3D arrangement of chemical groups common to active molecules and essential to their biological activities.

In an attempt to discover lead compounds with significantly improved potencies, the Michigan group finally considered a fourth pharmacophore model based on known potent DAT inhibitors of other groups such as 14, 15, 16, 17 and also their own piperidinol lead 2.
