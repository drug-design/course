### Almost Science Fiction
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.

Computer graphics enables us to visualize complex machinery underlying highly coordinated biological processes. Geometrical measurements, shape analyses, design and evaluation of candidate prototypes are all operations that are used daily by the usual locksmith but these operations are more complicated in drug discovery. Today, research teams using very unusual visual apparatus work hours and hours with 3D graphical displays and can virtually "enter" into the precise 3D structure of a protein and construct atom by atom an inhibitor that can lead to a drug that will stop the development of a disease. One would think that the following scene is taken from a science fiction movie but today it is possible with computer graphics!

### History of Molecular Visualizations

1970-1975: In the beginning, no graphical software programs existed for 3D drug design. Computers existed but they were mainframe computers. Physical models (plastic or metallic) were very popular and allowed "hand" manipulation of the three-dimensional structures.

#### 1975-1978

1975-1978: The second period witnessed the development of molecular modeling software in drug design. The output of these programs were generated numerically or with graphical representations produced by graphical plotters.

#### 1978-1980

1978-1980: One of the first commercially available graphical systems was "Tektronix" displays. They had poor resolution and no colors. They were so slow that it was not possible to envision that they could allow real-time rotations.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/molecular-graphics/1_3_3_1.png){: loading=lazy }

#### 1980-1995

1980-1995: "Evans &#38; Sutherland" graphics system revolutionized molecular modeling. They provided colored pictures of excellent quality and included real time rotation and stereo. However the cost of a single display was $150,000! Towards the end of that period, "Silicon Graphics" introduced less expensive yet high performance workstations that were within the budget of most academic and industrial laboratories (approximately $ 30,000).

#### 1995-now

"1995-now": A large range of graphic workstations became available to meet the need of modeling applications ranging from simple, small molecules to complex macromolecules. Basic inexpensive systems like PC or Macintosh combined with efficient graphic software were available for less than $1.000 and provided visualization means that were accessible to all.

### Commercially Available Molecular Kits

Hand-held commercial models have the advantage of being concrete objects that can be manipulated and provide a physical "feeling" of their actual geometrical features. It is not possible to construct on a routine basis proteins, neither is it easy to introduce a molecule in its active site or to superimpose together two or three proteins or two or three small molecules. Molecular graphic software programs offer great flexibility and include the visualization of color-coded properties that are associated to the different structural fragments.

### Molecular Graphics Functions

A molecular graphics system should provide the following three basic functions. Editing: Some type of "construction kit" must be available so that molecules can be built and modified. Visualization: Each molecule should be visualized in three-dimensions, color-coded and labeled. Manipulation: It must be possible to move and rotate molecules independently in any direction and about any axis and to manipulate their torsion angles.

## 3D Perception

### The Perception of the Third Dimension

Although defined in 3D, the molecular representations are visualized on a 2D computer screen. In drug design, good perception of the three-dimensional nature of the molecule is essential and many techniques of graphic software provide a three-dimensional illusion.

### From 3D Coordinates to Screen Coordinates
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer

The representation of a molecule (3D object) on a graphic display actually consists of calculating a series of projections of the 3D object onto the 2D plane of the screen.

#### 2D Projection is Not Sufficient

The 2D projection is not sufficient. You have to rotate the object to perceive its 3D features. The following represents the crystal unit of Zirconium. Notice the difference when you rotate it!

### Stereo

Whereas real-time manipulations provide a 3D feeling, stereo is critical to maintain that three-dimensional perception. Stereo perception involves presenting a left and right eye view of the molecule to the appropriate eye of the user. In this case, dividing the screen into two halves provides stereo and the left and right views are represented and are ready to be mentally superimposed by the user.

### Hardware Stereo

Hardware stereo is a trick incorporated in graphics systems. The monitor runs at double the frequency so that the screen presents alternate eye views one after another. The user wears a pair of goggles containing liquid crystal shutters and an infrared emitter on the workstation synchronizes the visibility of the screen to each eye. These capabilities are sometimes incorporated in the hardware and software equipment of a workstation and are available to support effective hardware stereo.

## Visualization

### 3D Representation of Small Molecules

Molecules can be displayed with different rendering techniques including Line, Stick, Ball and Stick, CPK etc...


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/molecular-graphics/menu1.png){: loading=lazy }
#### Line

This is the simplest and most common way to visualize molecules where the bonding arrangement is represented in 3D. This type of representation is also called "wireframe".


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/molecular-graphics/snap_v1_d1_3_1_1.png){: loading=lazy }

#### Stick

In this type of representation the bonds are represented as tubes. It is also called "polytube".


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/molecular-graphics/snap_v1_d1_3_1_2.png){: loading=lazy }

#### Ball &#38; Stick

Here the molecule is displayed as the assembly of atoms and bonds. Atoms are represented as small spheres and bonds as tubes.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/molecular-graphics/snap_v1_d1_3_1_3.png){: loading=lazy }

#### CPK

In this type of representation the molecule is defined as a set of spheres of van der Walls radii of the individual atoms.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/molecular-graphics/snap_v1_d1_3_1_4.png){: loading=lazy }

### Quality of Rendering

Although considered as a sphere, in molecular graphics visualizations, an atom is treated as a polyhedron. A view calculated with a small number of faces is of poor quality; however by increasing the number of faces the quality increases.

### Atomic Color-Code Convention

A color is associated with each type of atom. The following color-code convention is generally accepted and implemented in most popular molecular graphic systems.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/molecular-graphics/3_7_internet.gif){: loading=lazy }

### Coloring Molecules or Sets of Atoms

Molecules can be colored in different ways: by atom-type, by molecule, by color, by properties etc...


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/molecular-graphics/menu2.png){: loading=lazy }
#### By Atom-type

In this representation the atoms are colored according to the atomic color-code defined and a color is also given to half of the bonds of this atom.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/molecular-graphics/snap_v1_d1_3_4_1.png){: loading=lazy }

#### By Molecule

A different color is given to each of the molecules visualized in the screen. It is useful when several molecules are superimposed to distinguish and recognize the individual molecules in the view.

![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/molecular-graphics/snap_v1_d1_3_4_2.png){: loading=lazy }

#### By Color

All or part of a given molecule is visualized in one color. Interactive "picking" of the molecule or a set of atoms allows one to associate a color with a specified set.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/molecular-graphics/snap_v1_d1_3_4_3.png){: loading=lazy }

#### By Properties

Various molecular properties can be visualized. The quantitative or qualitative variations can be color-coded defined and visualized for every element considered: atom, bond or the molecular surface.


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/molecular-graphics/snap_v1_d1_3_4_4.png){: loading=lazy }

### Labeling Functionalities

Various labels can be added: those which are associated with the molecules and those associated with the screen. The first ones move with the molecules (green) and the other ones are fixed (white).

![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/molecular-graphics/snap_v1_d1_3_5.png){: loading=lazy }

#### Atom Labels

If an entire molecule is represented in one color, it is not possible to recognize the different types of atoms. It is useful to label specific atoms in order to facilitate further analyses (e.g. hydrogen bonding capabilities or atomic mimicry).


![](https://media.drugdesign.org/course/molecular-graphics/snap_v1_d1_3_5_2.png){: loading=lazy }

#### Atom Numbering

This type of representation is useful when associated with computerized numerical treatments or to follow the 3D view associated with a publication in which some details are given and atoms are described by their number (Nitrogen 24, or hydroxyl of Ser-76).

## Editing &#38; Manipulation

### Structure Manipulation &#38; Editing

In molecular modeling, the computer software provides tools that interact with the molecules visualized onto the screen. The most basic structure manipulations are: translation of all molecules, translation of one molecule relative to another, rotation of all molecules, rotation of one molecule relative to another, rotation of flexible bonds in a molecule, and molecular editing. These operations also are useful for the superimposition of molecules or for the insertion of a small molecule into the cavity of a macromolecule.

### Slab and Clip

Some molecular softwares incorporate "slab" functionalities. The aim of this operation is to visualize sections of the molecular volume. A projection plane can be moved and everything which is either above (top slab) or below (bottom slab) are removed. This allows one to better analyze for example the detailed volume of a macromolecular cavity or a free protein or with a bound ligand.

### Visualization of Properties on Molecular Surfaces

Molecules are not inert entities. They have subtle physico-chemical properties (atomic charges, electrostatic potentials, hydrophobicity, polarizability) that strongly influence the way in which molecules interact with one another. The display of molecular surfaces that incorporates the added dimension of molecular properties will allow one to understand and predict how molecules interact with one another and dock with one another as well. It also aids in designing new molecules that will optimally bind to a target receptor. The corresponding surfaces can be displayed using color codes and contour lines.

#### Visualization of Properties on Molecular Surfaces

Contour lines are usually drawn in a plane like in geography. In the case of molecules, the contour lines are drawn on the 3D envelope of the molecule. The line connects points with the same value of the property (e.g. electrostatic potential) and a number is associated to the curve indicating the actual value of this property (e.g. energy). Contours with positive values are drawn in red while contours with negative values are drawn in blue.

### Mathematical Boolean Operations with Volumes

Mathematical operations (e.g. logical Boolean treatments such as AND, NOT, OR) are useful. These kind of operations are essential for some drug design techniques, such as the Active Analog Approach. Operations such as addition or subtraction of volumes are also useful in measuring for example the quality of a superimposition or the amount of space that is occupied by a ligand in a receptor site. The following example displays the volume common to two molecules.
*[Analog]: A molecule structurally similar to another, generally based on the same scaffold
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.

### Complementary Surface Properties

It is possible to visualize the complementary features of a given property (e.g. lipophilicity, electrostatic potential etc.) of a ligand when it binds to its receptor. This can be done by displaying the property concerned onto the surface of the molecule when it is outside and inside the active site of the receptor.

### Results of Quantum Mechanical Calculations

Quantum mechanical calculations provide a way to measure many properties of the molecule including electronic densities, localized orbitals, molecular orbitals (in particular the LUMO and HOMO orbitals). They provide detailed insight into the electronic nature of the molecular structures. Instead of treating them numerically, it is recommended to use computer graphics to visualize this information and take advantage of the graphical capabilities to facilitate their analysis.
