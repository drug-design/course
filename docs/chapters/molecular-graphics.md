### Almost Science Fiction
*[nce]: New Chemical Entity: a compound not previously described.

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-graphics/almost-science-fiction-f2d9dedb'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Computer graphics enables us to visualize complex machinery underlying highly coordinated biological processes. Geometrical measurements, shape analyses, design and evaluation of candidate prototypes are all operations that are used daily by the usual locksmith but these operations are more complicated in drug discovery. Today, research teams using very unusual visual apparatus work hours and hours with 3D graphical displays and can virtually "enter" into the precise 3D structure of a protein and construct atom by atom an inhibitor that can lead to a drug that will stop the development of a disease. One would think that the following scene is taken from a science fiction movie but today it is possible with computer graphics!

### History of Molecular Visualizations

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-graphics/history-molecular-visualizations-b60b3626'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>1970-1975: In the beginning, no graphical software programs existed for 3D drug design. Computers existed but they were mainframe computers. Physical models (plastic or metallic) were very popular and allowed "hand" manipulation of the three-dimensional structures.

#### 1980-1995

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-graphics/1980-1995-67f43404'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>1980-1995: "Evans &#38; Sutherland" graphics system revolutionized molecular modeling. They provided colored pictures of excellent quality and included real time rotation and stereo. However the cost of a single display was $150,000! Towards the end of that period, "Silicon Graphics" introduced less expensive yet high performance workstations that were within the budget of most academic and industrial laboratories (approximately $ 30,000).

### Commercially Available Molecular Kits

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-graphics/commercially-available-molecular-kits-7c9c21d1'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Hand-held commercial models have the advantage of being concrete objects that can be manipulated and provide a physical "feeling" of their actual geometrical features. It is not possible to construct on a routine basis proteins, neither is it easy to introduce a molecule in its active site or to superimpose together two or three proteins or two or three small molecules. Molecular graphic software programs offer great flexibility and include the visualization of color-coded properties that are associated to the different structural fragments.

### Stereo

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-graphics/stereo-09fd6e27'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Whereas real-time manipulations provide a 3D feeling, stereo is critical to maintain that three-dimensional perception. Stereo perception involves presenting a left and right eye view of the molecule to the appropriate eye of the user. In this case, dividing the screen into two halves provides stereo and the left and right views are represented and are ready to be mentally superimposed by the user.

### Hardware Stereo

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-graphics/hardware-stereo-2f0a86b8'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Hardware stereo is a trick incorporated in graphics systems. The monitor runs at double the frequency so that the screen presents alternate eye views one after another. The user wears a pair of goggles containing liquid crystal shutters and an infrared emitter on the workstation synchronizes the visibility of the screen to each eye. These capabilities are sometimes incorporated in the hardware and software equipment of a workstation and are available to support effective hardware stereo.

## Editing &#38; Manipulation

### Structure Manipulation &#38; Editing

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-graphics/structure-manipulation-amp-editing-d4b13002'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>In molecular modeling, the computer software provides tools that interact with the molecules visualized onto the screen. The most basic structure manipulations are: translation of all molecules, translation of one molecule relative to another, rotation of all molecules, rotation of one molecule relative to another, rotation of flexible bonds in a molecule, and molecular editing. These operations also are useful for the superimposition of molecules or for the insertion of a small molecule into the cavity of a macromolecule.
*[molecular modeling]: A field that models molecular behavior with theoretical methods and computational techniques.
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-graphics/visualization-properties-on-molecular-surfaces-5602da23'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Molecules are not inert entities. They have subtle physico-chemical properties (atomic charges, electrostatic potentials, hydrophobicity, polarizability) that strongly influence the way in which molecules interact with one another. The display of molecular surfaces that incorporates the added dimension of molecular properties will allow one to understand and predict how molecules interact with one another and dock with one another as well. It also aids in designing new molecules that will optimally bind to a target receptor. The corresponding surfaces can be displayed using color codes and contour lines.

#### Electrostatic Potentials

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-graphics/electrostatic-potentials-49ae6c7f'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Electrostatic potentials: a surface can be color-coded by electrostatic potentials and for example displayed in two colors (red &#38; blue) when the surface is either positive or negative. A good affinity between the ligand and the receptor occurs when positive regions (red) interact with negative ones (blue).
*[affinity]: The affinity of a ligand is its ability to bind to its biological target.
*[ligand]: In Biochemistry: substance that binds to a biological receptor. In Chemistry: an atom or group of atoms.
*[ee]: stands for "enantiomeric excess". A quantity for measuring the optical purity and represents the percentage of the major enantiomer minus the percentage of the minor enantiomer

### Results of Quantum Mechanical Calculations

<button  class='playb' onclick='playAudio(this)' data-mp3-name='molecular-graphics/results-quantum-mechanical-calculations-1e95bbee'><i class='fa fa-play' aria-hidden='true'></i></button>Quantum mechanical calculations provide a way to measure many properties of the molecule including electronic densities, localized orbitals, molecular orbitals (in particular the LUMO and HOMO orbitals). They provide detailed insight into the electronic nature of the molecular structures. Instead of treating them numerically, it is recommended to use computer graphics to visualize this information and take advantage of the graphical capabilities to facilitate their analysis.
