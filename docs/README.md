!!! note annotate "What is drugdesign.org?"

    Learn for free drug design, drug discovery, medicinal chemistry, cheminformatics, structural bioinformatics, molecular modelling, computational chemistry, property prediction, QSAR, etc...

    The content of this website is based on the "[Molecular Conceptor](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17313460/)" multimedia course developed by Synergix between 2001-2013. More than 40 worldwide experts in their fields have contributed to its contents. drugdesign.org is dedicated to the memory of [Dr. N. Claude Cohen](site/claude-cohen.md) a drug design pioneer and main course contributor.

!!! note annotate "The Sharing Program for Teacher"
     
    You teach a course in medicinal chemistry, drug design, cheminformatics, bioinformatics or molecular modelling etc... <br/>
    Donâ€™t waste time reinventing the wheel, join our "Sharing Program" and start using any drugdesign.org material in your own presentation (e.g PowerPoint etc..). Chery picks from a large collection of high-quality topics and media. In addition, we will provide you with a dedicated subdomain so you can customize your syllabus, and organize everything as you like. In return you will give back new content to the library, so others can use it ([more on this program](site/sharing-program.md))

!!! Info annotate "Support This Project"
    drugdesign.org is a free access resource but in order to maintain it and develop further this project we need your help
    so if you enjoy the content support us by donating to this project.
