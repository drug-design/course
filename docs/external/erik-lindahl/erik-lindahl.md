If you are interested in learning how fundamental biophysics about biological macromolecules such as proteins, DNA, and membranes, and in particular how models, statistical mechanics and simulations can be used to understand them, I teach a class in Molecular Biophysics. All lectures have recently been recorded in high quality (4k50fps) combined with using a lightboard for visualization, they have been partitioned into short concepts, and are available as a playlist on YouTube.
