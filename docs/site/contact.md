!!! Info annotate "About Me"
    My name is Elie Cohen. I've been working with my father, N. Claude Cohen, on the Molecular Conceptor project for over 12 years. This project has involved a lot of hard work and many talented people. I believe we have created an unparalleled and impactful body of content that remains essential for anyone aspiring to understand the fundamentals of drug design.
    In the coming months, my focus will be on integrating 3D molecular structures into the course to enhance both its educational value and user experience. My overarching vision for drugdesign.org is twofold: firstly, to guarantee free access, and secondly, to update its content and facilitate community contributions of innovative content.

!!! Info annotate "Contact me"    
    You can contact me at drugdesign@yahoo.com I will be glad to hear your feedback, suggestions, etc...
    The source of truth of drugdesign.org is based on [this Github repo](https://github.com/drug-design/course). The best way to submit text modifications or suggestions is to create a Pull Request (PR in Github jargon). If you don't have any Github experience, just write to me.

!!! Acknowledgments
    In the development of this website, we have utilized the NGL Viewer, an advanced web application for molecular visualization. The NGL Viewer has significantly enhanced our ability to present complex molecular structures in an accessible and interactive format.

    We extend our gratitude to the creators of the NGL Viewer for developing such a valuable tool. In accordance with their guidelines, we would like to acknowledge their work with the following citations:
