    My name is Elie, I have been working with my father N. Claude Cohen for more than 12 years on Molecular Conceptor. The last year I have been pretty busy transforming "Molecular Conceptor" content to work in a browser. Unfortunately, I had to give up on 3D molecules which was a key feature of the original software, and switch to gif pictures. I want drugdesign.org the  be a new beginning of something great and big. Deciding that content should be free is challenging and I hope the donation will cover the maintenance and development of drugdesign.org.  

!!! Info annotate "Contact me"
